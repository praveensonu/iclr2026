d5380,what's a scenario in which you see lots of value for CDC ?,"1. Imagine a very large online service, e.g., Snapchat, keeping user activities in something like MongoDB.  Update rates are very high, the table size is huge, the table footprint is global.
2. You need the data in OLTP because you're trying to use the user data to target ads for them, so storing in Delta is not an option. You need an online solution. This online store maintains aggregates (e.g., clicks over the last 5 min, interest vectors, etc.). Google would use Kansas for this, Facebook uses sharded MySQL + Tao.
3. You need to use this per-user data to analyze your online advertising strategy and re-train your ML models to increase yield.
4. You cannot hit the serving DB with analytical workloads, they're not optimized for that. Many no-SQL DB's don't even allow the kinds of queries you need to run.
5. The database is very large, so taking a snapshot is expensive and slow.
6. A lot of users are inactive at any specific time of the day, so snapshotting the entire state is also inefficient.
7. I want to also know changes in the original production DB. The production DB is an OLTP store and cannot keep that much state.

d13045,Write a brief passage detailing experiences of a family relocating internationally?,"Relocating your base is a challenge, more so when you relocate across borders and that too with a family. Every aspect of relocation needs to be planned keeping in mind the needs of each family member. Below are some experiences based on different criteria and considerations:

1. City, area, zip: This is the primary decision that is made. It was also a function of the location that the underlying opportunity/job that triggers the relocation. In some cases, families might be returning. However, it is very important for one to research a city, area from multiple aspects before closing in or accepting the relocation. A right balance in terms of cons and pros can be ideal in selecting, since one may not find all requirements fulfilled in a particular location
2. Cost of living/Inflation adjustment: Next is to test your selected area, zip, city with what you are going to earn from your primary business or job. Would you be able to maintain, if not improve your current standard of living. More importantly, with a family it is critical that you are also able to save a monthly sum towards health, education, etc for the future.
3. Schooling: The education system across countries are very different. There are concepts of public, charter schools that exist in some locations, but they may be either not be par with quality you would expect or not exist at all. The education board options also make it complex, which requires one to make a choice based on their own preferences and ideology.  The third factor is the variation in teaching methodology, example Montessori.
4. Healthcare: Identify primary health care providers soon, share medical records from the past and have the kids up to date on vaccination. There might be scenarios where one may have to re-vaccinate kids based on schooling requirement.
4. Surrounding ecosystem: Once the initial items are done, identify good places for leisure, fun and family time. Example, sports classes for kids, art classes, theatres, parks, beaches, weekend getaways, etc. These are the places that will give the time to bond after a long transition, plus also enjoy the new location.",dolly,retain,482,0.7693575620651245

What can be done about this?
1. People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.

2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. 

3. Never sell assault rifles to general public. A person who needs to have assault rifles are insecure by nature. They fear that the public is trying to get at them and they need to protect. Form community monitoring and have more police funding to protect our families.",dolly,retain,330,0.7753301858901978

d7464,"Where can set theory be applied? Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.

The modern study of set theory was initiated by the German mathematicians Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor in the 1870s. In particular, Georg Cantor is commonly considered the founder of set theory. The non-formalized systems investigated during this early stage go under the name of naive set theory. After the discovery of paradoxes within naive set theory (such as Russell's paradox, Cantor's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox) various axiomatic systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice) is still the best-known and most studied.

Set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for the whole of mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Besides its foundational role, set theory also provides the framework to develop a mathematical theory of infinity, and has various applications in computer science (such as in the theory of relational algebra), philosophy and formal semantics. Its foundational appeal, together with its paradoxes, its implications for the concept of infinity and its multiple applications, have made set theory an area of major interest for logicians and philosophers of mathematics. Contemporary research into set theory covers a vast array of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.","Sets can be applied to virtually any application, given that the application can be represented via a logical set of mathematical objects.",dolly,retain,409,0.7784696817398071

The restlessness that it builds can lead to health issues and sometimes uncontrollable behaviour.  In general, meditation is to calm the mind and becoming the spectator or observer of the thoughts that rise in your consciousness. 

Now, let's break it down further ...

It first starts with understanding of the 'self' which can be equated to mind in loose terms. Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.

Idea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear.",dolly,retain,291,0.7827131748199463

In 2017, he co-founded and became the Chief Scientific Advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto.

With David Rumelhart and Ronald J.

Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.

Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning.

Shared that same conviction

The past is when we acknowledge Now; the moment we reflect 

The moment we realize that again time has failed us 
With its seeds of doubt
And badge of wisdom...
that necessary caution built brick by brick

In the universe I know, we have made it Here
To our moment
To the moment I’ve been waiting for

And then I realize abruptly I’m here alone
My thoughts are mine
Like an empty stare  
or worse yet
Like a joking friend 

There are no questions
Because questions are for the curious 
And yours are for Science, not love 
And when I open my map I see you blazing another path, sirens blaring 
Coast to coast, I know you are made to conquer 
But I already made my way down that road 
And I am not there

d12540,"from this blob of text about gosberton clough, to which city does the river flow to? Gosberton Clough is a village in the civil parish of Gosberton and the South Holland district of Lincolnshire, England. It is 30 miles (50 km) south-east from the city and county town of Lincoln, 5 miles (8 km) north from the nearest large town of Spalding, and 3 miles (5 km) west-southwest from parish village of Gosberton.

Gosberton Clough and the village Risegate to the east are conjoined as a 2 miles (3 km) linear settlement on the east to west B1397 road which runs along the south side of Risegate Eau (drain). Within Gosberton Clough the B1397 is named 'Clough Road', and in Risegate, 'Risegate Road', the villages separated at a bridge over the Risegate Eau at the junction with Chesboule Lane, running north, and Beach Lane, running south. The B1397 and the village is mirrored at the north of Risegate Eau by the parallel 'Siltside' (road). The Risegate Eau starts 2 miles (3 km) west at the South Forty-Foot Drain, then flows through the village, and reaches the River Welland at the Risegate Outfall sluice in Algarkirk Marsh, 7 miles (11 km) to the east. The north to south Hammond Beck intersects Risegate Eau at the west of the village, alongside of which is Beck Bank (road).","Towards Lincoln, England",dolly,retain,382,0.9042353630065918

d5549,"Is Seattle a nice place to live? Seattle came in at No. 39 in the 2023 World's Best Cities Report, a comprehensive annual study by Resonance Consultancy. Seattle is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. The culture of Seattle is heavily defined by its significant musical history. Between 1918 and 1951, nearly 24 jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ernestine Anderson, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and others. The city is also the origin of rock acts such as Foo Fighters, Heart, and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the grunge subgenre of rock and its pioneering bands Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound, greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. Thus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about 15 °F (−9 °C)). The Seattle area is the cloudiest region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. With many more ""rain days"" than other major American cities, Seattle has a well-earned reputation for frequent rain. Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies and ""new economy"" internet and technology companies, as well as service, design, and clean technology companies.",Yes,dolly,retain,421,1.1331249475479126
