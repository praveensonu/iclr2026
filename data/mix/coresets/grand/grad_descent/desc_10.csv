d13131,what to ask when interviewing doulas?,"Ask about their certifications, experiences, expectations, rates and contract details. Certifications and years of experience in either one specialization or full spectrums speak a lot about their credibility. You can poke into details by asking for a few examples of how they would handle specific situations. For example, for postpartum doulas, you can ask them how to take care of a newborn’s cord before it fully heals or how to help mothers suffers postpartum blues. You should also be able to get a certain level of understanding of their personalities and lifestyles through a 30 min interview. It is important to find someone who matches your expectation and is easy for you and your family to get along with. How much the doulas charge should be discussed during the interview. Make sure you reviewed the details of the contract before signing it. Towards the end of the interview, don’t forget to ask for 2 - 3 referrals from previous clients.",dolly,retain,237,0.6288275718688965
d6794,What is bicycling and why would someone do it?  Is bicycling healthy and joyful or is it painful and a waste of time?  How many bicycles should you have?  Which part of the world do you find the most people bicycling?,"Bicycling is a form of human powered movement that typically involves sitting or standing on a machine with two wheels that can be propelled forward by using one's arms or legs.  The bicycle was invented in the early 1800 (1817) by a German inventor named Drais.  The early bicycles were built from wood and soon after used heavy steel for the frame and wheels.  These steel bikes were called Boneshakers because when you road on them you would feel every stone and bump through your bones.  Bicycling exists in nearly every corner of the world, on every continent and it is done by all people.  In many countries, bicycling is the primary mode of transportation for people, especially in urban settings.  Bicycling is also a professional sporting competition where men and women race against one another in large groups in front of cheering crowds.  Bicycling is a very efficient form of converting power generated by a human into forward motion.  While most humans can't run faster than 10 miles per hour for more than a few miles, humans can go much faster and often hundreds of miles when using a bicycle.  Because modern bicycles use pneumatic tires and have many gears, it is considered a very healthy form of exercise.  People who love bicycling often have many different bicycles for different conditions, such as dirt or gravel, pavement, snow and even sand.",dolly,retain,371,0.6288372874259949

d3251,"What is a economic trait of Generation Z (Gen Z)? As consumers, members of Generation Z are typically reliant to the Internet to research their options and to place orders. They tend to be skeptical and will shun firms whose actions and values are contradictory. Their purchases are heavily influenced by trends they see on social media.

In the West, while majorities might signal their support for certain ideals such as ""environmental consciousness"" to pollsters, actual purchases do not reflect their stated views, as can be seen from their high demand for cheap but not durable clothing (""fast fashion""), or preference for rapid delivery. Moreover, young Western consumers of this cohort are less likely to pay a premium for what they want compared to their counterparts from emerging economies.","Gen Z are dependent on the internet to do research and also to place orders.

d5518,"Some people describe braising as ""transformative"". Why is this so?","Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures.",dolly,retain,232,0.6289228796958923

d5304,What are some ways by which humanity could quickly work to cool down the planet to minimize the effects of global warming?,"One idea humanity to implement to rapidly cool the planet to help minimize the effects of global warming would be to block some or all of the sunlight (UV radiation) hitting the planet from the sun. Sometimes referred to as GeoEngineering, these are projects on a truly planet-size scale. A project like this could, for example, consist of large reflective lightweight solar sails or other loft-able reflective material which could be seeded into the upper atmosphere to reflect some or all of the sunlight back into space. Another Idea would be to create massive and plentiful Co2 scrubbers to remove a noticeable quantity of the greenhouse gas, Co2, which works to reflect and prevent heat from the planet from leaving back out into space. Greatly reducing the quantity of Co2 in our atmosphere would allow more heat to escape the planet and consequently cool it down. Yet another thought might be to artificially and greatly increase the size of our ice caps which would lead to more sunlight being reflected back out into space. Yet another approach could be to mimic nature in prior heavily volcanic periods and inject massive quantities of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere in the hopes of producing conditions that in the past led to mini ice-ages.",dolly,retain,306,0.630121111869812
d8931,What kind of espresso machine is best for home use?,"Home espresso machines are a growing segment of the small kitchen appliance market. A good home espresso machine provides the ability to make high quality espresso in a machine that is typically smaller and less expensive than their commercial counterparts. 

There are three common espresso machine designs for home use: manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. As the name implies -- manual machines require direct ""manual"" control by the user, who typically applies pressure through a lever to deliver the desired brew pressure. Semi-automatic machines require the user to prepare the coffee into the portafilter, but then rely on an automated pump and to deliver the desired brew pressure for espresso. Fully automatic machines automate the entire process end-to-end: grinding the beans, loading the ground beans into the portafilter, and then pumping water through the portafilter at predefined pressure levels to brew espresso. 

Manual machines typically have a lower cost, smaller footprint, and provide the user with more direct control over the brewing process. This allows skilled users to make higher-quality espresso than they would with a more automated machine. In contrast, fully automatic machines are often the easiest to use, but are unable to make espresso as consistently great as a skilled barista could with a manual machines. Fully automatic machines are inherently more complex, more expensive to purchase, and more likely to have longer-term reliability issues. 

Regardless of the type of espresso machine, two factors influence how well they will perform: their ability to manage brew temperature and brew pressure. The best machines provide the ability to vary brew temperature and pressure in consistent, repeatable ways.The type of coffee bean and desired result will impact what temperature and pressure profile the user wants. The best machines offer flexibility along both dimensions in consistent, repeatable ways.",dolly,retain,396,0.6301325559616089
d8850,"I have wine tasting plans for the weekend , give me some tips so that I look like an expert","The most important part of Wine tasting is to enjoy it and have fun. There are five important steps to tasting wine which are described below.

See the Color  - Take a look at the color of the wine you are about to taste, it will give you a good indication on the age of the wine. Young white wines are clear and look like water, while older wines that have been aged in oak get a gold tint. Young red wines are vivid purplish red while older wines have brownish tones. 
Swirl the wine - Swirling the wine helps to expose the wine to more oxygen and release its aroma, this is called as aerating the wine. Watch how the wine runs down the glass. If the streaks of wine are thick and run relatively slow the wine has more sugar or alcohol. If the wine is thin and runs down the glass fast it has less alcohol. 
Smell the wine - After you swirl the wine take a sniff and it will smell much more vibrant. There are three types of aromas that wines have: primary are  fruity or floral, secondary ones come from aging in the barrels and tertiary are aging signs.
Sip the wine - Take a sip of the wine and spread it around your mouth to detect the different type of taste it provides. The tip of the tongue will give you the sweetness while the sides give you a good indication of sourness or acidity. 
Savor the wine- How does the wine feel after. Does it leave a bitterness or leathery feel on your tongue, it means the wine has more tannins.Does the wine feel light or dense , will give you a sense of whether it is light or medium bodied. 

After you have gone through the steps the most important thing is if you liked the wine. Take notes after each taste and you will eventually find out the type of wines you like.",dolly,retain,438,0.6301474571228027

The Hundred Years' War (French: La guerre de Cent Ans; 1337–1453) was a series of armed conflicts between the kingdoms of England and France during the Late Middle Ages. It originated from disputed claims to the French throne between the English House of Plantagenet and the French royal House of Valois. Over time, the war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fuelled by emerging nationalism on both sides.","The English and French fought numerous battles from the mid-14th century to the mid-15th century, hence the name, ""Hundred Years War."" The two sides made conflicting claims of sovereignty over land and people in an effort to be the dominant power in Western Europe, if not all of Europe. Engaging in warfare over this extended period of time resulted in a fairly rapid evolution of warfare and how countries conducted war.

d14656,Why is pricing important in the overall strategy of a product?,"When different profit levers like price, variable cost, fixed cost, volume of goods sold are compared, studies show that a 1% improvement in price can create the maximum operating profit improvement of 11.5% compared to only 2.3% through fixed costs. This goes to show that pricing can have a monumental impact on the bottom line. 

This can be achieved by understanding different pricing strategies and how they can be executed through pricing tactics. The different pricing strategy includes using - 1. Cost-side factors (like fixed, variable costs, incremental break-even analysis); 2. Customer-side factors (like Economic Value Analysis (EVA); Price Elasticity of Demand; Measuring willingness to pay) 3. Competitive environment factors. 

Based on the business context, these strategies can be implemented with tacts like price discrimination (e.g., bundling); non-linear pricing; price promotions (e.g., hi-lo pricing); and most of all understanding consumer psychology with respect to pricing (anchoring effect, decoy pricing, compromise effect, charm pricing, etc).",dolly,retain,267,0.6304689049720764

d1473,What are the pros and cons of working from home rather than going into an office downtown?,"There are both advantages and disadvantages from working from home, and they apply differently to different people depending on the person's personality, family situation, location, and job description. Some key advantages are the ability to develop closer personal relationships with team members, have the opportunity for more spontaneous casual conversations, and experience more productive meetings because of the ability to read people's body language and to see presentation materials more clearly. Many people will experience better mental health by going into the office and establishing a sense of greater connection with team members. In addition, certain employees will take advantage of remote work to use work time to engage in personal activities rather than real work, to the detriment of the employer. Some disadvantages of going into the office include the time inefficiency from commuting, the cost of commuting, the time inefficiency that occurs from experiencing all the social chatting that occurs in the office, and the hassle of having to schedule conference rooms. Commuting also contributes to global warming through the greater use of fossil fuels.

Therefore, while planning your trip to Europe, first consider what kind of experience you want, for example, whether you want a more modern holiday or a rustic vacation, whether you want to spend time on the beach or rather partake in winter sports or activities. Consider also whether you like warmer climates or enjoy winter weather. Once you have established that, consider your budget and for how any days you can travel.

d4182,What batting traits make a good baseball or softball hitter?,"There are many traits that great baseball and softball batters share.  Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  

All great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.

With their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. 

There are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important.",dolly,retain,252,0.6308973431587219

d11268,Is brazilian jiu jitsu good for self defense?,"Brazilian Jiujitsu, or BJJ, is known as the gentle art in martial arts.  BJJ can be practiced in two modalities: Sport BJJ and the other as self defense. Sport BJJ is competitive and based on a point system based on a competitor being awarded a number of points based on advancing to a more advantageous position. Alternatively, a competitor may immediately win the match by submission. When BJJ is used in self defense, the goal is usually to subdue an attacker.  Since BJJ is mostly grappling from the ground, it can be a highly effective practice for self defense as many street fights end up on the ground. While many of the techniques are intended to immobilize an opponent, it can be less effective if the opponent has an unfair advantage such as the use of a weapon. Practicing BJJ routinely will prepare the practitioner mentally for physical combat which can be advantageous in a self defense scenario. Another reason BJJ can be viewed as good for self defense is that there are techniques that can work well for different body types that level the playing field for even smaller or weaker opponents. If both opponents are trained in BJJ, size and strength can become a larger factor.  Routine training can also lead to increased physical fitness as classes can be quite rigorous and physically demanding. Some may argue that more ruthless martial arts are intentionally designed for self defense and therefore may be more effective.",dolly,retain,336,0.6310721635818481
d476,Explain how a mechanical watch works,"A simple mechanical watch works by transferring power from the main spring, a tightly coiled metal spring, through an escapement and balance wheel, to wheels representing seconds, minutes, and hours.

The watch uses a gearing from the main spring that pushes an escapement gearing against a ruby palette to oscillate a balance wheel. The balance wheel and escapement are carefully constructed to oscillate at a specific frequency, releasing small bursts of power to the gear train. The train is constructed to gear the specific frequency of the balance wheel into seconds, minutes and hours. 

Further complications like chronographs, sun phase, alarms, and others are not accounted for in this simple watch. An automatic watch contains a weighted rotor in order to wind the mainspring with the motion of a person's arm.",dolly,retain,201,0.6311207413673401
d4293,"What is a nickname of Jiang Zemin Moha (Chinese: 膜蛤; pinyin: Mó Há, pronounced [muǒ.xǎ]), literally ""admiring toad"" or ""toad worship"", is an internet meme spoofing Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader. It originated among the netizens in mainland China and has become a subculture on the Chinese internet. According to another explanation, it comes from China's social media Baidu Tieba. In the culture, Jiang is nicknamed há, or ""toad"", because of his supposed resemblance to a toad. Netizens who móhá (worship the toad) call themselves ""toad fans"", ""toad lovers"" or ""toad worshippers"" (simplified Chinese: 蛤丝; traditional Chinese: 蛤絲), or ""mogicians"" (膜法师; 膜法師) which is a wordplay on mófǎshī (魔法师; 魔法師, magician) in Mandarin.[note 1]

Another nickname for Jiang is ""elder"" or ""senior"" (长者; 長者; Zhǎngzhě), because he once called himself an ""elder"" or ""senior"" when he was berating Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung who questioned him. A video clip recording this event spread on the internet and led to the rise of the culture, which later greatly rose in popularity around 2014, when Hong Kong was experiencing a period of political instability. Initially, netizens extracted Jiang's quotes from the video and imitated his wording and tone, for parody and insult. However, as the culture developed, some imitations have taken to carrying affection toward him.

d8386,What options does the Federal Reserve have to fight inflation?,"The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, and its remit is to provide the nation a more stable and durable monetary system. The Federal Reserve, or the Fed, is specifically tasked with maintaining maximum employment while ensuring price stability. The United States is currently experiencing persistent inflation. Typically, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when initially trying to combat inflation. The increased rates make lending more expensive, and subsequently discourages capital investment and borrowing. The added cost in turn reduces demand for products and services. Lower demand normally leads to dropping prices to try and motivate potential buyers. The other primary method involves open-market operations. When inflation is running higher than expected, the Fed can reduce the money supply by selling securities and taking currency out of circulation. Since there are fewer dollars in circulation, each remaining dollar is correspondingly worth more than it was before those transactions.",dolly,retain,222,0.6311952471733093

In contrast, it can be challenging to get around many cities in the United States without a car.

During the build-up to depart Tanith, aChaos fleet that splintered off the main force of the coreward sector descended on the world.  Without a strong planetary defense and no time to prepare, Gaunt decided to save what soldiers he could for the imperium instead of fighting.  As chaos began attacking the planet, Gaunt organized the emergency launch of available Tanith troopers.  When all was complete, only a single strength regiment was able to get off the planet.  Tanith itself was destroyed by  the forces of Chaos from orbit and Trooper Larkin, a sniper in the regiment, dubbed the regiment 'ghosts'.

Over the years, she has gradually gained weight because of her sedentary lifestyle and changing metabolism. Besides adopting healthy dietary and exercise habits, how can she build self-esteem and improve her body image?","Mental health plays a big factor in building self-esteem and improving her own body image. Tearing away from negative cycles of thoughts, such as the way she self-describes or visualizes her own body, can be powerful in improving her own self-esteem. For example, a shift from focusing on what her body looks like to what it can do is a popular strategy; instead of focusing on the quantitative metrics of how big her legs are, for example, she can focus on the fact that her legs are strong and allow her to swim, run, hike, and do many other things well. By extension, this also involves things that are outside of physical appearance, such as focusing on great qualities she has that have nothing to do with physical fitness nor appearance: this can help with self-esteem. Finally, she can be mindful of how she perceives not only herself, but other people: is she judging them also by their physical appearance?

Preparation ensures that the appropriate texture has been introduced to the top layer of the concrete and helps the epoxy to bond with the concrete better. This ensures long-lasting results. All of these different methods of preparing concrete vary in terms of the level of difficulty as well as the efficacy produced. Following are the most popular techniques:

1. Acid Etching: This is the most DIY friendly option & involves the use of an acid that is allowed to rest for some time over the concrete surface and then cleaned after a few minutes. This is also the quickest among all the techniques. The downside however is that the etching process may not produce the best concrete texture that ensures a long-lasting bond. 
2. Walk-behind Concrete Diamond grinder: This produces one of the best results when compared to the other techniques. It involves the use of a walk behind concrete grinder which has been fitted with a diamond grinding attachment. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires specialized equipment which may not be readily available & is a lot more time consuming compared to Acid etching.
3. Hand Grinder with Diamond Cup Wheel: This is the most accessible option that yields results that are equivalent to using a walk-behind concrete grinder.

In general, for people to migrate from India to the US one of the main criteria is exceptional academic performance with post graduate university qualifications in addition to being very proficient in English.So, the parents of these children of Indian origin have a strong academic educational background and try to create an environment at home that places great emphasis on academic learning.

SpellBee has become very popular with the events being telecast on TV. The event is becoming more popular among the Indian community in the US as they see Indian kids being successful in the contests and getting national recognition when they perform well in SpellBee. When the Indian parents find that their kids are showing some aptitude in spelling and are capable of putting in the required effort, the parents start motivating the children to start practising for SpellBee contests. 

These children of Indian origin spend significant effort over a period of several months or in some cases even years fine tuning their skills to practise for SpellBee contests.

Many residents of this sparsely populated region resent the control of these lands by distant bureaucrats whose regulations place significant restrictions on how the land is used. For this reason, movements have been ongoing for many years to work for the transfer of those lands to local authorities. While this sense of disenfranchisement is understandable, the truth is that local residents would suffer more from the loss of centralized management of these lands than they would gain through local control. This region is mostly desert, a landscape and ecosystem that is unusually vulnerable to degradation. Without the concerted efforts of an administration that can apply consistent regulation and stewardship of these lands across a broad territory that crosses state boundaries, the value of these lands to local residents would decline even further, becoming less productive and less attractive to the hunters, fishermen, and other tourists whose spending represents the majority of income for many of these Intermountain communities.",dolly,retain,279,0.6325516700744629

Because the Great Gatsby is ultimately a story about wealth and excess, as well as human greed, this color is a purposeful choice to associate the idea of wealth always being just out of grasp.

The Statute of Limitations is a common example of laches where a plaintiff is precluded from bringing an action due to inordinate delay.

A defense of waiver claims that the plaintiff knowingly and intentionally signed away, relinquished or otherwise abandoned the right which it claims was violated by the defendant. A common example of a waiver is when one engages in a dangerous act for pleasure such as sky diving or rock climbing. The instructor or facility would have the purchaser sign a waiver for bodily harm suffered from engaging in the dangerous act.

Both defenses are affirmative defenses and must be raised for them to take effect. It is important to note that affirmative defenses can themselves fall to laches and waiver.",dolly,retain,226,0.6328756213188171

Classic cross-country skiing involves a striding technique in which the skier keeps their skis parallel to each other and is best done in a narrow, groomed track. Skate skiing is considered more challenging to learn and involves a skiing technique that resembles the motion of ice skating and roller blading. Skate skiers also typically use a groomed trail but it is wider and smoother than the narrow grooves for classic skiing.

d14831,"Thinking about public opinion, what is the significance of “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”?","Issue consistency is how consistent an individual American’s opinion is about an issue and is measured in two ways. Measuring across time shows that individual Americans are not likely to have the same opinion at two different points in time.  For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.
Levels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.  Third, are “group interest”, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.  Fourth are “nature of the times”, when evaluations of candidates and parties are tied to general perceptions about how things are going.

U.S. Justice Department and FBI investigators have amassed new evidence indicating possible obstruction by former President Donald Trump in the probe into classified documents found at his Florida estate, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing sources.

FBI agents seized thousands of government records, some marked as highly classified, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in August. The investigation is one of two criminal inquiries into the former president being led by Special Counsel Jack Smith.

Trump, who was indicted on Thursday in a separate inquiry in New York, has denied any wrongdoing in the cases and describes them as politically motivated.

After his advisers received a subpoena in May demanding the return of the classified records, Trump looked through some of the boxes of government documents in his home out of an apparent desire to keep certain things in his possession, the Post reported, citing people familiar with the investigation.

Investigators also have evidence indicating Trump told others to mislead government officials in early 2022, before the subpoena, when the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration was working to recover documents from Trump's time as president, the Post reported.

The FBI referred questions to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

In a statement to the Post, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said that the ""witch-hunts against President Trump have no basis in facts or law,"" and accused Special Counsel Smith and the Justice Department of leaking information to manipulate public opinion.

Smith's investigations are among a growing number of legal worries for Trump, who in November launched a campaign seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.
In addition to the New York probe, Trump faces a Georgia inquiry over whether he tried to overturn his 2020 election defeat in the state.","Following a historic first of an indictment of a former president, Trump also faces increased activity across 3 other investigations.",dolly,retain,421,0.6337435245513916

There are a few reasons many people cite for why the sport is so popular:

- It is a quick game to learn.  The rules are pretty simple, and more importantly, the skill needed to hit functional shots in the game is not very difficult to learn.  Compare it to tennis, where it can take multiple lessons from a professional teacher just to get to a point where you can hit a few good shots.  With pickleball, almost anyone of any age or fitness level can pick up a paddle and be playing a game in just minutes.

- Pickleball culture has tended to be very inclusive.  Many pickleball groups make it a point to be very inclusive of all ages, races and backgrounds.  This often creates a sense of community for players, and makes them more likely to keep playing and invite friends along, thus growing the sport.

- It is a fun way to get in a decent workout.  While not as taxing as, say, tennis, pickleball can be a good workout.  Especially since unlike tennis there is very little downtime.  The pace of games is very quick and involves near constant movement.

d14471,"Tell me a few highlights about Madonna's impact on pop music. Madonna Louise Ciccone (born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Dubbed the ""Queen of Pop"", Madonna has been widely recognized for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production, songwriting, and visual presentation. She has pushed the boundaries of artistic expression in mainstream music while continuing to maintain control over every aspect of her career. Her works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. A prominent cultural figure of the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna remains one of the most ""well-documented figures of the modern age"", with a broad amount of scholarly reviews and literature works on her, as well as an academic mini subdiscipline devoted to her named Madonna studies.

With sales of over 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is the best-selling female recording artist of all time. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and has achieved the most number-one singles by a woman in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. With a revenue of over U.S. $1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing female touring artist worldwide. Forbes has named Madonna the annual top-earning female musician a record 11 times across four decades (1980s–2010s). She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of eligibility.

Perhaps they want your attention, or they might be fearful or anxious and are barking to alert you. Also, barking habits can also be very breed specific. Some breeds are known to be more vocal than other breeds. It's important to try and understand why they are barking to then initiate the proper course of action to address their barking habits. If you believe they are barking for attention, one idea is to make sure you are not rewarding their barking by distracting them with a treat or playtime. By doing this, you are teaching them that if they bark, the dog will get what they want. Instead, you might want to consider a couple items. First, is the dog getting enough exercise or releasing their energy. Increase their stimulation by walking them more, playing with them, or socializing them with other dogs or humans. This added stimulation may reduce their need for attention. If they are barking because they are fearful or anxious, think about what is happening or what the environment is that may be cause their fear or anxiety. Then, try and change the environment or situation so the dog feels safe. One action that may help is providing a safe place for your dog, such as a dog crate or dog bed, so they know exactly what to do when they are afraid or anxious. Training them to go to their safe place may provide the comfort they need to reduce their barking habits.",dolly,retain,353,0.635138750076294

d2047,Identify and briefly discuss four “commandments” for effective presidential relations with the Congress. Do you think a president needs a good relationship with Congress to be an effective president?,"There are ten commandments for effective presidential relationals.  I will discuss four of these commandments. The first that I will discuss is that the president should respect Congress as an equal institution. President Obama said, “If Congress doesn’t act, I will.”  He went on to use executive orders to enable the policy that he was trying to enact.  The problem with this method is that Trump was then able to revoke those acts, undoing all the work that Obama accomplished.  The second is bi-partisan support for Presidential programs.  If both sides take ownership of an issue, it tends to make it easier to enact policy.  Third, the President needs to be able to compromise.  If he can’t compromise, he won’t be able to effectively negotiate a bill with Congress.  Fourth is the President needs a sound program.  If the program has no chance of success, then Congress won’t want to back it.
If we define a President as being effective when he creates lasting policy, then he obviously needs to have a good relationship with Congress.  If he’s not able to work with Congress to pass legislation, then his only other option would be to use executive orders to enact policy, which will typically not live past his Presidency.",dolly,retain,327,0.6351635456085205

Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato. Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters 日本 mean ""sun origin"", which is the source of the popular Western epithet ""Land of the Rising Sun"". The name ""Japan"" is based on Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.

d10374,What should I do to maximize my chances of getting into a top business school?,"There are many controllable factors that can help improve your chances of attending a top business school such as Harvard, Stanford, or Wharton.  Four of the most important include:
- Track record of impactful work experience
- Strong letters of recommendation from your supervisors
- Excellent GMAT score and, to a lesser extent, GPA
- Compelling essays 

Work experience is often cited as the most important factor for business school admissions.  Candidates should look for jobs that involve building best-in-class business skills (such as working at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey) or involve leading large groups of people to accomplish important and challenging projects.  One piece of advice is to look at the resumes of successful applicants and see what types of roles they had pre-MBA.

In addition to having excellent work experience on your resume, it is equally important to have a track record of success at those jobs.  To evaluate track record of strong work performance, business schools require 2-3 letters of recommendations.  It is critical for these recommendations to be highly positive, and any lack of enthusiasm can be an instant red flag for admissions officers.

In terms of quantitative factors, Harvard, Stanford and Wharton have high average GMAT scores.  Harvard's median GMAT score, for example, was 730 out of 800 for the class of 2024.  Be sure to invest time in preparing for the GMAT, as candidates can significantly increase scores through consistent and dedicated practice.

Additionally, the essays candidates submit are very important.  The goal of a business school admissions officer to is find candidates who are likely to reach senior executive leadership or other impactful roles in society.  Your essay would ideally reflect a) an aspirational but attainable goal to reach a high impact position, and b) a clear path to get from where you currently are to your long-term goals, including a logical short-term goal immediate post-business school.

Some candidates opt to hire an MBA admissions consultant, which typically costs between $2000-3000 per application.

d12510,"How was Liberum Veto mis-used? The liberum veto (Latin for ""free veto"") was a parliamentary device in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the Sejm (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting either Sisto activitatem! (Latin: ""I stop the activity!"") or Nie pozwalam! (Polish: ""I do not allow!""). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The liberum veto was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive (absolute monarchy).

Many historians hold that the liberum veto was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, and the Commonwealth's eventual destruction in the partitions of Poland and foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of Poland. Piotr Stefan Wandycz wrote that the ""liberum veto had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy"".

d4986,Why is Kanye sometimes regarded the GOAT (Greatest of All Time)?,"Kanye Omari West (""Ye"") is debated as being the GOAT by many in the hip hop scene due to his prolific and arguably genius utilization of samples in his production. Starting off as merely a producer for Roc a Fella records, he quickly rose to international acclaim with his debut record ""The College Dropout"". His freshman album topped the Billboard charts for a long stretch of time and featured absolutely iconic and inspired tracks such as ""Jesus Walks"", ""Family Business"", and of course ""Through The Wire"", the infamous track where Kanye provided vocals following a car crash that forced his jaw to be wired shut as a result.

Following his initial success, Kanye released banger after banger with ""Late Registration"" and his stadium album ""Graduation"". He followed on to release what many consider to be his magnum opus with ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" which received critical acclaim despite mixed reviews from popular internet music nerd Anthony Fantano.

Not to be stopped, Kanye was on the track to certified Godhood, dropping ""808s and Heartbreak"", a track that laid the foundation for artists like Juice WRLD, Frank Ocean, and The Weekend to discover their own sounds. Modern R&B really does have Kanye to thank.

His discography continues with the controversial ""Yeezus"", ""The Life of Pablo"", ""Ye"", and ""Kids See Ghosts"". The latter of which even internet music melon Anthony Fantano awarded an unprecedented 10. Despite a decline in the quality of his recent releases with ""Jesus is King"" and ""Donda"", the insane influence Kanye has had upon the music industry and the hip hop / production scene at large can not be understated. His resume alone speaks for itself and is a jarring indictment of him being in contention for the title of GOAT.

Despite heated debate and a multitude of haters, ultimately, many fans simply suffice to speak the undeniable truth ""He made Graduation"".",dolly,retain,446,0.6358116865158081

d3897,What do I need to know about drones to become a hobbyist drone pilot?,"Aerial drones are a great way to gain a unique perspective and view of the world we live in.  As a recreational drone pilot you can capture and immortalize the incredible views experienced in nature while engaging in many outdoor activities. Many also engage in racing and building highly customized high speed drones using first person view (FPV) goggles to fly against other pilots in a close loop course. Before engaging in this fun and rewarding activity there are many rules that a drone pilot must be aware of in order to safely and legally operate your drone. These rules do not apply to racing drones in sanctioned races but do apply to all drones flown in public airspace.  All drones over 0.55lbs or 250g need to be registered through the FAA website and can not weigh over 55lbs.  If you plan to fly your drone over highly populated areas such as towns, sporting events, or concerts you will need to check local rules and ordinances that require special local licensing, insurance, or approvals.  Many higher end drones come with automated software that provides a geospatial mapping software in their interface that lets you know if you are flying in any restricted areas.  These include airports, helipads, government facilities, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.  All hobbyist drone pilots must follow two main rules.  You can never fly above 400 feet and regardless of range you must keep the drone within line of sight.  You are completely responsible for any damage your drone causes in the event of loss of control that results in a crash.  Lastly, use common sense and don’t invade others' personal space or to invade others’ personal privacy.  Staying within these guidelines can provide a joyful and rewarding experience for those who both fly and view the content produced by this hobby and will ensure our ability to do so into the future.",dolly,retain,425,0.6358439326286316

d13416,Make up a plausible fishing story about the one that got away. Write in the first person.,"Minnesota is the land of 10,000 lakes. A few years ago, my brother and I decided to try our luck at one of the best rumored spots for largemouth bass, Otter Tail Lake. We arrived just after dawn and walked about 30 minutes from public access parking to a secluded bank which we hoped to have to ourselves. 

There was not much action. My brother questioned our choice of bait, nightcrawlers, but I told him to keep faith. We were hungry, but realized we'd forgotten our pastries in the car. My brother offered to fetch breakfast. I continued to fish while he was away.

I felt a hard tug on my line. I pulled back on the rod to confirm the bite. I had something big on the line! Carefully I turned the crank, pausing periodically to give the fish a chance to exhaust itself. My patience paid off. I could see the bass in the water a few yards off shore. It appeared to be larger than my arm. I turned the crank and pulled hard on the rod to finish the job. The fish was a fighter, but I felt good about my chances. But suddenly my line snapped and the bass disappeared. 

When my brother returned, I told him my story. He was a skeptic. We did not go home empty handed as we landed 3 smaller bass, the largest weighing 4 pounds. But I felt disappointed.

d3099,Is the Vex or FIRST robotics competition a better choice for a child in high school?,"Both VEX and FIRST have very strong robotics competitions for the high school level.  If you are a parent choosing between the two, multiple factors need to be taken into consideration.
The first factor is the availability of a robotics program in your area.  While you can form an independent team that is not affiliated with your school or another organization, it will require a significant financial and time investment.  At the high school level teams typically design their robots with CAD software and must machine the parts themselves.  Teams often consist of 20 or more members so that all of the aspects of the competition can be covered, such as creating and assembling the hardware, electrical wiring, systems design, programming and documenting the engineering process.  All of the parts and equipment need to be purchased and maintained, and members put in a lot of hours during the competition season.  Joining a pre-existing team that already has equipment, members and mentors familiar with a program will make it easiest for a child to participate, regardless of which competition the team is a part of.
If both VEX and FIRST programs are available, then it depends on how intense of an experience the child is interested in.  The VEX competition has a lower barrier to entry because it requires smaller robots.  Two pairs of robots compete against each other in a match to see which pair can get more points.  While teams will need to machine some parts and must have skills in electrical and software design, a team can be smaller and still compete effectively.  The FIRST competition involves much larger and more complex robots and challenges.  Two alliances of three robots each compete against each other in a match, with a total of six robots on the field at once.  Teams need to have more members to effectively compete, and participants need more in-depth training on hardware, electrical, system and software design.  There is also a business requirement, where teams have to create a marketing banner, brochure and video for their team to submit as part of the competition.
Whether you choose VEX or FIRST, a child in high school that participates in a well-run robotics program will gain valuable engineering and organizational experience that will serve them well, both on a college application and after graduation.",dolly,retain,501,0.6377877593040466

Digital watches typically use an electronic circuit to keep track of time. They generally are mass-produced and are inexpensive but highly accurate in keeping time. 

On the other hand, Mechanical Automatic watches typically use a rotor, or metal weight, to power the timepiece and keep time. The rotor is powered by the movement of the watch wearer's hand. Premium watches are handmade and can be pretty expensive. They also are the least accurate in keeping time. However, watch enthusiasts still love and collect these watches. 

Mechanical non-automatic watches typically use a quartz crystal to keep track of time. These are inexpensive and very accurate at keeping time. 

So the best watch for you depends on what you are looking for. If you have a tight budget and care about accurate timing, then digital or non-automatic watches might work well.

The general consensus on the global energy Insights is that the core energy commodities will follow these trends : 

-Hydrocarbons  ( oil and Gas) 
Oil demand could peak in the next two to five years with steady decline after 2030. Gas demand is projected to grow by 10% in the next decade in all scenarios. with divergence after 2030, driven by increasing decarbonization pressure in buildings and industry. 

-Renewables ( Wind, Solar, Hydro) 
These are projected to account for 80—90% of power generation globally by 2050. Share of renewables in the power mix is projected to double in the next 15 years .

-Hydrogen 
Transport and new industrial uses could drive two-thirds of hydrogen demand growth to 2035.  Beyond 2035, hydrogen is projected to scale across all sectors of the energy economy.

Fossil fuels are responsible for over 75% of Greenhouse gas emissions and over 97% of carbon dioxide emissions. These reports have also stressed that there’s an immediate need to move away from these fuels in the near future. 

The challenge to this paradigm shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a combination of social and political barriers, the cost for new infrastructure to manage new energy portfolios , fossil fuel phase-out may lead to an increment in electricity prices and challenges to energy storage. 

In April 2022, McKinsey published their Energy Insights Global Energy Perspective report, where they highlighted a rapid increase in traditional energy ( Oil and Gas) over the next 5 years, however the report also shows a rise in renewable energy and Hydrogen following that 5 year mark. While each adoption of this will differ in each country, the consensus is we will have a mixed energy portfolio (renewables and traditional) for the next 3 decades. The data also suggests as we see technology improve for more sustainable management of assets, batteries and resources, we will see a decline in the extraction , transportation  and consumption of fossil fuels.",dolly,retain,335,0.6381849050521851
d12281,How do I make great Neapolitan pizza dough at home?,"To make great Neapolitan pizza you need 4 ingredients. Water, yeast, flour and salt. For best results you should use typo ""00"" flour. When using such finely grained flour go for a 65% hydration dough, 3% salt, and 0.5% dry yeast. This means for every 1000 parts flour, put 650 parts water.

Great pizza dough takes time to ferment. There are few ways to do it but the easiest one for the home is to pre-ferment a small portion of equal amounts of water and flour.

For example, start with separating out the total ingredients: 1000g flour, 650g water, 30g salt, 5g dry yeast. This will result in 1680g of dough enough for ~8 medium pizzas. Mix 200g of water, flour and the yeast and let it sit on counter for an hour. Then move to the refrigerator for slow fermentation for ~24h. Take this out and add the remaining ingredients. Kneed until smooth, and let it rest on the counter for 1h. Cover with olive oil to avoid drying out. Cut balls and place in a tray. Lightly cover with olive oil again and cling film.

The book ""Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error"" by Kathryn Schulz is an exploration on why humans have the tendency to disregard errors and think they are always right. Shulz describes how people start with the assumption that they are right in everything they believe, and when they realise they have made a mistake, instead of challenging this assumption, they actually feel relief and think: ""I was right except for this particular error I was making, but now that I have realised it I can certainly say that I am 100% right in everything"".",dolly,retain,294,0.6393038630485535
d1027,Is learning piano on a keyboard just as effective as learning on a grand/upright piano?,"Since the layout of keys for both electronic keyboards and pianos are the same, keyboards could be effective for beginners. However, Pianos have more “action” than keyboards (i.e. how the keys feel when pushed down, whether they are light or heavy).  So learning on a keyboard may not prepare a person for the heavier feeling of piano keys. If a piano is too costly or large, another option is learning on a keyboard with weighted keys that feel much more similar to a piano.",dolly,retain,156,0.6393274068832397

You get evaluated on filler words used, grammatical construction of your speech, speech tonality, and a general evaluation of your speech.  This works so well because you get practical insight into where you can improve in your communication skills in delivering prepared speeches.

d1795,Why do audiophiles spend lots of money on high-end audio equipment and does more expensive gear always sound better than less expensive hardware?,"While it is generally true that audiophiles are willing to spend more money on high-end gear than those less passionate about audio, justification for this additional financial outlay is not solely based on the equipment’s definitive sonic superiority.
 
There are a handful of key attributes that define audio equipment’s performance, including: frequency response, detail, texture, layering ability, coherency, vocal presentation, and timbre and tonality. Audiophiles typically seek out gear capable of performing well in many or all of these areas, and it is often these elevated expectations that drive an audiophile’s willingness to spend more. However, there are elements of subjectivity at play, as well as physiological differences, that can lead to variations in interpretation of what sounds “accurate” or “engaging.” Therefore, even if it is generally true that most expensive audio equipment objectively performs better than their lesser priced counterparts, individual preference and anatomy can cause differences in expectations or hearing that can lead to different perceptions of sonic performance, even with high-end audio gear.
 
The Erlkonig is an In-Ear Monitor made by German producer, Vision Ears. By many, it is thought to be one of the best In-Ear Monitors ever made. At a retail price of over $4,000, it is also generally considered to be quite expensive. Widely regarded to perform extremely well, the Erlkonig has 13 balance armature drivers, 4 user-selectable sound settings, and shells made out of silver. While non-audiophiles will likely scoff at its price and be indifferent to the Erlkonig’s specifications, many audiophiles will salivate at the chance for even a single listen. Even though many deep-pocketed audiophiles could justifiably purchase the Erlkonig, there are plenty of audiophiles and non-audiophiles who do not enjoy the IEM’s sound. For others, the shell is ergonomically incompatible with their ears. So, even if expensive audio gear on the whole performs and sounds “better” than lesser priced gear, unique preferences and anatomical variation also shape perception of sonic performance.",dolly,retain,499,0.6398891806602478

d8954,How comes a free-diver does not get crushed by the pressure when diving?,"Every 10 meters under water, the pressure increases by 1 bar, which is approximately one standard atmosphere unit.
This means for example at 50 meters deep, the pressure the diver is receiving is six times higher than at the surface.
For most of the body, composed of tissues and fluids, this is not a problem as they are incompressible.
However, the air contained in the lungs being pressurised will reduce in volume inversely proportionally to the pressure. 
If the individual dives with a tank, he will be able to inflate his lungs, but if the diver is free-diving, the volume of air is limited (being the one taken at the surface).
In our previous example, the volume contained in the lungs would be divided by 6, which is in principle below their residual volume.
This means lungs will not be able to deform themselves anymore, and a depression will appear in the thorax of the free-diver
hence risking the lungs to collapse.
The latter would though not happen, as the depression created in the lungs from not being able to get deformed anymore will generate an influx of blood that strengthen the lungs structure, protecting them from being damaged.",dolly,retain,294,0.639923095703125

Second, they may want to work more closely with customers and work with people in general. A product manager needs to talk to customers very often to really understand their needs and requirements. A product manager also needs to work across functions to push a project forward so they need to influence others.

On the other hand, assuming that the model was already trained and that even though Adam's supercomputer took seven and a half million years to come up with the answer forty-two, perhaps he was more prescient than even he realised at the time. It's quite a conundrum. Maybe his model was simply too large? Or maybe it was just the right size and it was the compute that was the issue? If Deep Thought had followed a distributed compute model perhaps involving all the planets of the universe, rather than simply relying on the Earth, which always seemed like a single node build, then perhaps his answer would have been richer in its philosophical content.

d13683,How do you make pizza?,"Pizza comes in many styles. I make Neapolitan pizza, which generally requires a high hydration dough and a very high oven temperatures. The dough is made with four cups of flour, three tablespoons olive oil, a cup and a half of water, one package of yeast, a tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon and a half of salt. I typically activate the yeast in lukewarm water and sugar first, then mix all the ingredients in a stand mixer with a dough attachment. I'll add additional water until the dough is very wet, let it rise once in the mixing bowl, then turn the dough out on a surface coated generously with flour. Then I quarter the dough, fold a few times, and let rise again. 

Forming the pies is the tricky part. I've found pushing the dough into a rough circle with my fingers as a first step works well, but he dough will tend to snap back. I'll pick up the small dough circle and stretch it out on top of my fists to start to break the gluten and form a larger pie with a thinner base. I use an Ooni oven pre-heated on high, but turn the heat down when I'm ready to put the pizza in. The peel needs to be generously coated with flour to get a good launch into the oven. After a few seconds, the dough on the bottom will cook enough that manipulating the pizza becomes much easier. I keep the toppings simple, mozzarella (low moisture), tomato sauce, basil.

Maui's amazing beaches offer surfing, outrigger paddling, stand-up paddling, fishing, kite surfing and other activities for novice or experienced water lovers. More of a land-lubber than a mermaid? Take a hike in the Haleakala volcano crater or one of many other hikes around the island.

d7486,Why is baseball called America's Pastime?,"Although its popularity is arguably greater in Latin America and Asia now, baseball is still commonly referred to as ""America's Pastime."" This is partly because game was invented in the United States 180 years ago and was the dominate sport for much of the time since. But baseball is also a game obsessed with its own history, much like America is with hers and we can trace a lot of the story of baseball alongside the story of America. 

While the country was fighting itself to determine the shape of its future during the Civil War, the game of baseball was taking shape and spreading to the south by northern war prisoners. After the war, when mass market commercialism became available, baseball and its products were the primary sport marketed to people across the country. Many of the first American celebrities were in fact baseball players, their faces and names seen by millions of people through the rising circulation of newspapers and distribution of baseball cards.

Even later, baseball was at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement. Jackie Robinson became the first Black player to play Major League Baseball in the modern era. The integration of baseball was an early and important step in the broader Civil Rights Movement. Since then, baseball has been one of the most diverse sports in the world, its demographics closely representing that of the whole country.

In many ways, baseball culture has become synonymous with American culture in general. The season takes place through summer. There are hot dogs, nachos, a lot of sitting around, fireworks, and games on 4th of July.

So even as more countries and cultures find a way to make baseball their own, the sport can always claim its place as America's Pastime.",dolly,retain,380,0.6409792900085449
d11325,Is Scala a good programming language?,"There are some pluses to Scala: it is statically typed, it has a lot of syntactic sugar that allows you to write very compact code, it is inter-operable with Java so you can use any Java library that exists. However there are plenty of downsides:
  - there's too many ways to do the same thing (for example ""a.b"" is the same as ""a b"")
  - there's often entire sub-languages that spin out (e.g., when doing shell manipulation), and it's hard to understand these obscure sub-languages
  - there is a breaking upgrade from Scala 2 to Scala 3, which means that Scala 2 people are stuck with it, without improvements.",dolly,retain,190,0.6410166621208191

For example, if they arrive in the warmer months, say May to September, then an excellent place to start would be the freedom trail. This is a marked track that follows the famous ride of Paul Revere as the British forces arrived in Massachusetts Bay prior to the war of independence. During the warmer months, this path is nice to walk along as it will take your family along the landmarks of Boston, through the Boston Common, past the Quincy Markets, the Bunker Hill memorial, and through Boston's North End where some of the best Italian restaurants in the country can be found. In addition to this, Boston is home to two of the most prestigious universities in the world, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Free walking tours are available on both of these campuses which are located on the other side of the Charles river in the city of Cambridge. You can also go to a baseball game at the famous Fenway Park stadium to see the local team, the Red Socks play, as well as enjoy the city's shopping district along Newbury St. and the Prudential. 
If, however, your family visits in the colder season, or worse during the peak of winter, Boston still has plenty of fun and enjoyable activities. You could take them to an ice hockey game at TD Gardens to watch the local team, the Bruins play. There are also Christmas and winter markets in the Sea Port district throughout the holidays.

There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite.

- Price: How does it fit in your budget?
- Engine type: Do you want a traditional combustion engine, or go for an electric one?
- Number of cylinders: If you go for combustion engine, how many cylinders do you choose? Less cylinders are usually cheaper, make the motorcycle more lightweight and thus easier to maneuver. More cylinders make the engine feel smoother, also have more power, but are heavier and more expensive.
- Usage: What do you use it for? Just for fun, commuting to work, general transportation? Travel? Offroad? Racing?
- Assistance systems: Modern motorcycles have a range of assistance systems like ABS, Cruise Control, Distance sensors, electronic driving modes for different weather conditions etc. They can make driving safer , but also add weight and make the bike more expensive. Which ones do you need?  
- Style: There are different styles like naked bike, cruiser, chopper, dual sport, race bike , scrambler etc. Different styles can be more or less adequate depending on your usage, or you can simply pick the one that appeals to you.
- Size: The two most important aspects in terms of size are seat height and weight. Both have a huge impact on how well you are in control when not driving, for example when you need to stop at a traffic light or going slowly in stop & go traffic.
Seat height is important , so your feet can reach the ground when stopping. However the width of the seat and general width dimensions of the bike also play a role here. So two bikes with same seat height might feel very differently. Best is to try it out",dolly,retain,387,0.641369640827179

d8337,"what are some of the signs and symptoms of Dissociative identity disorder? According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), symptoms of DID include ""the presence of two or more distinct personality states"" accompanied by the inability to recall personal information beyond what is expected through normal memory issues. Other DSM-5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states, loss of one's subjective experience of the passage of time, and degradation of a sense of self and consciousness. In each individual, the clinical presentation varies and the level of functioning can change from severe impairment to minimal impairment. The symptoms of dissociative amnesia are subsumed under a DID diagnosis, and thus should not be diagnosed separately if DID criteria are met. Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID (intrusive thoughts or emotions) and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms (dissociation rendering them unable to remember specific information). The majority of patients with DID report childhood sexual or physical abuse. Amnesia between identities may be asymmetrical; identities may or may not be aware of what is known by another. Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse, shame, and fear. DID patients may also frequently and intensely experience time disturbances. Around half of people with DID have fewer than 10 identities and most have fewer than 100; although as many as 4,500 have been reported. The average number of identities has increased over the past few decades, from two or three to now an average of approximately 16. However, it is unclear whether this is due to an actual increase in identities, or simply that the psychiatric community has become more accepting of a high number of compartmentalized memory components.","Dissociative identity Disorder, or DIS in short, causes many symptoms that range from intrusive thoughts, and emotions to Amnesia. The severeness of Amnesia will vary between identities. Other symptoms include time disturbances between identities. Some of the other speculative signs include the number of identities that can range from 10 to 4500.",dolly,retain,464,0.6415594220161438

If the data still remains undelivered, the source is notified of this failure. Once the TCP receiver has reassembled the sequence of octets originally transmitted, it passes them to the receiving application.

Electric locomotives use electricity from overhead wires to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, making them lighter, faster, and quieter than steam or diesel engines.


How Does a Diesel Locomotive Work:
Diesel-electric locomotives provide cheaper upfront costs and improved reliability.

Train wheels are conical, allowing them to travel a longer distance while turning at the same speed as the inner wheel. The wheel on the left is positioned further out from the center of the axle than the right, which is beneficial for stability and comfort of the passengers. Railways have wide curves due to the ""flange"" of the wheel limiting lateral movement. Distance between tracks must be greater than wheel flanges to allow wheels to move laterally in curves, reducing efficiency and comfort. The ""nominal gauge"" of a railway is defined for the straight section and widened in curves to allow the train to tilt.",dolly,retain,231,0.6422006487846375

When waking up, the customer should be the first thought to naturally occur as you begin to consider your activities.

d11364,What and how should you feed your baby?,"What to feed your baby depends on a number of factors ranging from their age, their health and your preferences. Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like — the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe — void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.  Spoon-fed means the caregiver is selecting the foods and feeding the baby.  There is no right or wrong way to feed your baby.

Gravel bikes are great for covering offroad miles more efficiently and long days in the saddle both on road or offroad. However, the lack of any meaningful suspension means that or but a small amount of time off paths and more established trails will be hard work. Downcountry bikes will enable you to go on a wider range of terrain, inlcuding the ability to do trail riding (be very careful before trying to navigate downhill trails on a gravel bike!). However, downcountry bikes are usually heavier but the full suspension and geometry makes them less efficient compared to a gravel bike.",dolly,retain,207,0.6423888802528381

d11235,What are the various methods to offer support for the improvement of the traditionally underprivileged sections of the society?,"In many societies there are sections of people who are underprivileged. These people could be underprivileged because of several factors: ethnicity, religion, colour, language, nationality, gender, etc. The other people who do not come under the underprivileged section are the normal people.

The underprivileged people suffer major struggles in their life over decades or sometime over centuries. On the social development indices such as literacy, life expectancy, incarceration, health conditions, etc.. the underprivileged people lag behind the normal people significantly. Examples of underprivileged people include the indigenous people in many countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA and also the people of African descent in the USA. 

The people from the underprivileged communities have to brought into the mainstream and in order to achieve this objective,  the required job and career opportunities have to be created. Education is a powerful tool to equip the people to gain the skills required to perform the roles. These people have been deprived of education for a long time and so the governments and the social leaders have to take the initiatives to extend education to the underprivileged. There has to be a concerted effort over a long time, some times for even 50 to 100 years, to improve the skill levels of the underprivileged people by focusing on education and training.

The underprivileged people have to be empowered citizens of the society. In order to enable these people to overcome the handicap of the suppression they have suffered for a long time, leaders from these communities have to be involved in the decision making and governance forums in the society.  As an example, in Indian Parliament around 24% of the seats are reserved only for people from the underprivileged sections to contest and get elected to become members of the parliament. Using this model to reserve seats for the. underprivileged in the governance bodies, we can provide opportunity for the underprivileged to participate in the governance and enact laws that will protect their interests. 

A combination of education and empowerment would go a long way in improving the life of the underprivileged people in the society.",dolly,retain,471,0.6425616145133972

d12507,What is the best way to make a camp fire,"Nothing screams camping out in the wilderness like building a campfire.   The memories, conversations, scents, roasted marshmallows, and crackling of the wood are all part of the experience.   In order to build a strong campfire, you need to perform the following steps.
Step 1.  Clear a perimeter that is roughly 12 feet in diameter.   Make sure you are in an open area, where tree limbs are not hanging over the campfire to avoid secondary fires.   Before you start the fire, get all of the necessary components such as dry kindle/twigs, larger sticks, and larger logs, paper, and lighter
Step 2.   Build a small tepee shape with the dry kindle and dry small logs.    I would recommend adding paper with the kindle to assist in starting the fire.
Step 3.  Stack larger sticks around the teepee structure in a square formation.   Build up multiple levels, so the square structue is higher than the teepee.   This will help the fire expand and spread to the surrounding structure.
Step 4.  Light the paper in the teepee with a match or lighter, and watch the  dry kindle  start to catch.    At this early stage, you will most likely see smoke.   You may need to blow on the teepee structure lightly in order to add some oxygen to the fire and help it catch to the larger sticks square structure.
Step 5.  Once the square structure begins to light, start to add larger logs diagonally across the structure.   The diagonal formation will fuel the fire, and expand upwards .
Step 6.  Keep adding larger logs to maintain the fire.   With the prior kindle, sticks, and logs already hot, adding the new larger logs will burn quickly and self ignite.
Step 7.   When you are done enjoying the fire, have a couple of buckets of water nearby to extinguish it.   Do not leave the campfire unattended as the hot coals and wind could cause a unintended spread.",dolly,retain,469,0.642916202545166

d11290,"Why is Andrew Jackson criticized for racial policies? Jackson used the power of the federal government to enforce the separation of the Native American tribes and whites. In May 1830, Jackson passed the Indian Removal Act through Congress. It gave the president the right to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the eastern part of the United States in exchange for lands set aside for Native Americans west of the Mississippi, as well as broad discretion on how to use the federal funds allocated to the negotiations. The law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program, but it was not implemented as one. Jackson's administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes, fraud and intimidation, and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe. The relocations could be a source of misery too: the Choctaw relocation was rife with corruption, theft, and mismanagement that brought great suffering to that people.","During Andrew Jackson's presidency the Indian Removal Act was passed by Congress. Even though this legislation was designed to give the President flexibility in negotiating with native American tribes, the President chose a harsher course of actions as a matter of course. Instead of offering voluntary relocation, there was a great deal of forced tribal relocation, as evidenced by the experience of the Cherokees and the ""Trail of Tears."" Other examples of unfair treatment by President Jackson including reaching agreements with leaders from tribes who often did not fully represent the tribe.

Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.

It was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.

The technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.

Apart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed.",dolly,retain,269,0.643752932548523

modifications would you make, if any?","In practice, she may find some improvements in her hip flexibility, but certainly this is not the right, nor optimal, technique to improve her hip flexibility. She risks injuring herself with this kind of movement. This is because every tendon has a stretch reflex, and when triggered, will cause the muscle connected to it to contract; for example, when the patellar tendon underneath your knee is hit by your doctor during your yearly checkup, your quads contract involuntarily and your leg kicks up. When you are stretching, you are elongating the muscles. If you bounce while stretching, you can activate your tendon’s stretch reflex, causing your muscle to try and contract while also elongating it, which may tear the muscle or even detach the tendon from the bone in extreme cases.

Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky, see what happens when you include the ground or not, and remember to let your eyes adjust to the dark and look around yourself, while you're taking the photos!",dolly,retain,328,0.6439851522445679

d7123,What are books are available to get an understanding of California prior to the gold-rush of 1849?,"A great resource for pre-Gold Rush California is the book ""Two Years Before the Mast"" by Richard Henry Dana who stepped away from Harvard Law School and signed up for a tour on the merchant vessel out of Boston in 1834. The book describes the voyage around the treacherous Cape Horn under the leadership of a hard and driving captain who shows little remorse or regard for his crew as the ship is battered below the cape by the confluence of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Awareness of Ahab of Melville's Moby Dick cannot help but inform your mental picture of this captain. 

The ship makes its way up the coast, passing the newly independent countries of South and central America, to the northern part of Mexico, an area called Alta California. Traveling along the coast, the ship trades with the Spanish and indigenous peoples in tiny settlements and missions named San Diego, San Pedro, San Juan, Nuestra Señora La Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncula, Santa Barbara, Monterey and north to San Francisco Bay. 

Dana's detailed descriptions of the natural harborages and the tiny settlements and missions are richly described and contrast sharply with the California we see today. One is left with the singular impression of the remoteness of California to those traveling from east cost of North America or Europe.  

The crew was trading in hides and tallow, incredible to those reading from contemporary times, who consider the distance of the journey and the archaicness of the cargo.

I am Ao Ni, I send this email regarding a cancelled flight of mine and to request documents to claim my travel insurance. 

I just received an email from you that my flight from Las Vegas to New York today at 10 PM was canceled due to mechanical issues. Even though Delta Airline will refund me the cost of flight ticket, the last minute ticket for tomorrow's flight is extremely expensive, almost double the normal price. I have to get back to New York by tomorrow to attend a very important meeting so I have to pay for the ticket, plus one night stay at a hotel for tonight. 

Will you reimburse my hotel and ticket? If not, I will have to claim it through my travel insurance and I need two documents to support my case. First, the confirmation of my order. Second, I need a letter from you to state the reason of the cancellation and that Delta Airlines is not able to reimburse my loss.

Secondly, everyone I know with a cactus hasn't watered it in about eighteen centuries and somehow it is still quote unquote ""alive."" Shallow roots, really? You never water it ever, it is not real, admit it.

d1385,"Given this reference paragraph, who coined the term dead man zone? The term dead man zone was coined by members of the CSIRO research team in Australia who were investigating the spread of bushfires (Project Vesta). The dead man zone is approximately 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) around the fire that is likely to burn. This dead man zone can be a safety net for firefighters if the fire is moving at a high speed. The dead man zone can also be prepared in a way that slows down the fire. Firefighters can get outside the dead man zone safely without seeing what the fire is going to do and develop a plan of attack or defense upon the fire's next move. If the dead man zone is not used, wind change can sneak up on the firefighters and resulting in potentially unsafe distances where they are not able to defend themselves. This can be a life or death situation if not approached properly, and there have been examples of firefighters that became trapped and ultimately killed in Australia. Project Vesta, headed by scientist Phil Cheney, found that when the wind changes direction, the line of fire will move out at its maximum rate of spread almost immediately, and that the spread speed was nearly three times what was previously thought. Project Vesta's research into bushfire behavior makes up the majority of what is known about bushfires today.",The team was created by the Australian CSIRO research team,dolly,retain,318,0.6456348896026611

d4213,is keto diet healthy?,"The keto diet is originally designed in clinics to relieve seizure symptoms in children with epilepsy. The diet prescribes intake of nutrients be majority from fat, a small percentage from protein, and very low carbohydrate. The low carbohydrates diet is adopted by people who want to lose weight. Some claim that they burn fat more effectively and reduce glucose levels because the diet makes you feel less hungry after each meal and limits the amount of sugar. However, solid research proof of the diet’s effectiveness in treating obesity or diabetes is limited. As a highly imbalanced nutrient diet, keeping a long-term keto diet can be challenging or even risky. Long-term keto diet could cause low blood pressure, kidney stones, constipation, nutrient deficiencies, eating disorder, and an increased risk of heart disease.

The next best step is to protect your pieces while taking out several of your opponent's pieces. The pawn structure needs to be aligned in a way that protects the king at all times and clears the way for the queen to strategically advance forward into the opponent's side. Another strategy is by making the move of casting that pushes the king to the corner as opposed to being exposed in the front once pawns are taken out.",dolly,retain,185,0.6463705897331238

Tennis is considered to be a demanding sport both physically and mentally. The players have to be in top shape and be ready to duel out many tough 5 set matches during the course of the slam.  During grand slam matches, players can run anywhere from 3 to 4 miles with most of the movement being lateral. The top players have the distinct advantage that they have large support staff including dedicated physios and massage therapists who can get the player ready for subsequent matches. Besides, the top players have coaches who may have themselves won slams, and thus carry a wealth of experience. Sometimes players also enlist the services of data analysts who can do opponent video/data analysis to determine patterns/preferences of opponents.

The Sun Belt has seen substantial population growth since post-World War II from an influx of people seeking a warm and sunny climate, a surge in retiring baby boomers, and growing economic opportunities. The advent of air conditioning created more comfortable summer conditions and allowed more manufacturing and industry to locate in the Sun Belt. Since much of the construction in the Sun Belt is new or recent, housing styles and design are often modern and open. Recreational opportunities in the Sun Belt are often not tied strictly to one season, and many tourist and resort cities, such as Fort Lauderdale, Gulf Shores, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Myrtle Beach, New Orleans, Orlando, Palm Springs, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Tampa, and Tucson support a tourist industry all year.
The traditional explanations for the growth are increasing productivity in the South and West and increasing demand for Sunbelt amenities, especially its pleasant weather. Job decline in the Rust Belt is another major reason for migration.","Since WWII, many people have migrated from the US Midwest or Northeast to the Sun Belt.

d120,"What is SVM? In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.","SVM stands for """"support vector machine"". It is a machine learning model for supervised learning tasks. It was popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, before deep learning take off. The classic use case is binary classification, but its extension can also do multi-label classification as we as regression. Kernel methods greatly enhanced SVM's capability to perform non-linear machine learning tasks.",dolly,retain,477,0.6471269130706787

Through tariffs, taxes and subsidies, It can also influence under which conditions and with which countries trade is conducted. Similarly, economic policies guide the regulation of carbon emissions. These choices are often limited due to scarce resources (e.g., money, time, information).

In relational databases, the SQL language is used to modify and access data.

Different database systems have different core functionalities based on their targeting working environments. However, most of them share following characteristics:

d14554,"Are the racial depictions of Eugène Delacroix artworks facts? Racial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eugène Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.",There are arguments that some of the depictions of the artworks are factual represents of Delacroix's first-hand experience while traveling in North Africa.,dolly,retain,360,0.6482294797897339

Food is critical to human survival, and nutritious food is a prerequisite for creating and maintaining a healthy human body and mind. Consuming the wrong kinds of foods can wreak havoc on human metabolism, and over time, lead to hormonal disorders, obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The world is witness to increased cases of such disorders since the time of the industrialisation of the food and pharmaceutical industries. After World War 2, since the 1970s, the rates of incidence of the aforementioned diseases have increased manifold, correlated strongly with the increased consumption of processed foods, seed oils, sugar and carbohydrates while being negatively correlated with the consumption of saturated fats and red meat. Thus, while the average life expectancy of human beings has increased, albeit differently for different regions of the world, with the increasing contribution of modern medical practice, the quality of life for most people has decreased.

The United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) classifies roads based on functions which are created based on attributes such as speed limits, route length and spacing. Based on the road functions we can categorize roads into the following categories.
1. Interstates and Arterial System
2. Other Arterials
3. Collectors
4. Locals

The interstate system is the at the top of road function classification system. They include Highways and Freeways with the highest speed limits and which allow for long distance travel without a lot of interruption. They are constructed using precise standards, signage and with safety considerations. They are also sometimes referred to as Arterial roads as they provide vital connectivity across regions in America. Interstate 95 or I-95 is an example of one such highway in the east coast of the United States which runs from Florida to Maine. The Principal Arterial system also comprises of U.S. Highways, which provide connectivity across regions which do not have an Interstate to support travel.

Other Arterials also include freeways and highways which supplement the Interstate system explained above. They have a slightly lesser speed limits. They typically connect cities and urban areas. Consider them as being minor highways. As an example, North Carolina Highway 55 (NC-55) is a primary state highway artery connecting multiple regional and urban areas in the state of North Carolina.

Collectors are critical for connecting urban population using local roads with the Interstate highways where applicable. They have more interruptions and are shorter in lengths. They also have lesser speed limits (30-35 mph). These can comprise of State highways which connect local roads with the Arterial highways.

Finally local roads provide connectivity between communities, regions, farms and other local areas. They form the lion's share of the United States road system.",dolly,retain,437,0.6494576334953308

d10785,"How would you describe the differences between Indian and Western music, especially as it relates to the sense of pitch?","Indian and Western music differ considerably in terms of pitch because Western music adheres to the concept of absolute pitch, while Indian music predominantly focuses on relative pitch. Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says ""A2"", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. 

In contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were ""sa"" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range.",dolly,retain,285,0.6497916579246521

d8996,"What's the significance of the lighthouse in Virginia Woolf's ""In The Lighthouse?""","The Lighthouse symbolizes human desire, a force that pulsates over the indifferent sea of the natural world and guides people’s passage across it. Yet even as the Lighthouse stands constant night and day, season after season, it remains curiously unattainable. James’ frustrated desire to visit the Lighthouse begins the novel, and Mrs. Ramsay looks at the Lighthouse as she denies Mr. Ramsay the profession of love he wants so badly at the end of Chapter 1. James, finally reaching the Lighthouse in Chapter 3 a decade after he’d first wanted to go, sees that, up close, the Lighthouse looks nothing like it does from across the bay. That misty image he’d desired from a distance remains unattainable even when he can sail right up to the structure it’s supposedly attached to. The novel’s title can be understood as a description for experience itself: one moves through life propelled by desire towards the things one wants, and yet seems rarely to reach them. One’s life, then, is the process of moving towards, of reaching, of desiring. It is “to” the Lighthouse, not “at” it",dolly,retain,296,0.6500450968742371

I shall wait in the west and the fox can wait in the east and ensure the prey do not escape to the east or west.
 
Good idea. so they all followed the plan. Along came a rabbit, ran helter skelter frightened  on seeing the fox and the wolf and straight into the lion, who with one swipe of its paw killed the rabbit. Next a donkey came by and met a similar fate. So did a deer. The lion felt they had sufficient food for their meal and asked the wolf of how we were going to share the meal. The wolf said that the fox can have the rabbit., the lion can have the donkey and he would partake of the deer. The lion knew the tastiest meat is that of the deer, and sensing the deviousness of the advisor wolf smacked him dead. Next he asked the fox for advice on sharing. The fox meekly replied that whatever way the lion wants to have the meal is fine and good. On hearing this the lion said you are a wise and good advisor, who is your guru? The fox humbly replied that the wolf was his guru.  Seeing the fate of the wolf the fox learnt from the wolf's mistake.

d7172,Are electric vehicles better for the environment than cars powered by fossil fuels?,"The rise of electric vehicles (or EVs) has been fueled by many factors -- including innovation, acceleration, design and tax breaks -- but the underlying assumption that electric vehicles are less harmful to the environment and may even mitigate global warming has been a primary motivator for hundreds of thousands of buyers.

Despite the virtuous aura of owning an electric vehicle, the jury is still out on whether EVs have a net positive impact on the environment or will do anything to curtail climate change.  That's because, while the experience of driving an EV may feel like a zero-compromise embrace of green energy, the vast industrial network needed to build and power EVs diminishes the halo effect. On the other hand, the fossil fuels that power traditional vehicles are definitely contributing to global warming and leave the world vulnerable to oil shocks and pressure from oil-producing countries. 

Whether EVs are better or worse for the environment is still to be determined. But a more insidious trend is the growing size and power of electric vehicles. Smaller vehicles, traveling fewer miles, represents a proven formula for reducing emissions and reversing climate change. But already, we're seeing the advent of electric trucks and SUVs, which are heavier, loaded with bells and whistles so they require more and more power to move people around. Coupled with the problem of drivers feeling like their EV gives them the right to drive as much as they want and you can see a reality emerging where the problem of Americans driving giant gas guzzlers is being replaced with American driving giant, power-sucking EVs.

The mainstream alternative (especially in first world countries) is pureed foods prepared especially for babies. Those that subscribe to BLW believe that the downside of feeding babies baby specific food is that the practice teaches babies to ignore natural instincts because someone else is in control of what type and how much food to eat.  Some reasons people choose not to follow BLW are: the misconception that babies cannot eat solid food,  the convenience of prepared commercial baby food, generally accepted mainstream guidance on baby rearing, or the lack of awareness of BLW.

In addition to lessons, you will also need the right gear to ski. This includes appropriate clothing that can keep you warm on the mountain while you ski, as well as ski equipment that you will use. It is recommended that you get a pair of skis and poles, good fitting boots, a helmet for safety, and goggles to protect your eyes from the elements. Renting your equipment is a good option when you're starting. That way you are not making an expensive commitment upfront. You could also buy your equipment either new or from any of the second-hand ski shops and ski swaps.
 
With the right gear and knowledge of the basics, you can take your learning in any direction you want. Many people choose to stay at a beginner or intermediate level and just enjoy the occasional ski trip with friends. While others take their passion forward with more practice, hours on the mountain, and likely more lessons to get to advanced levels.

Whichever path you pick, skiing can be a fun sport to learn and enjoy for the rest of your life. Have fun skiing. You got this!",dolly,retain,439,0.6523058414459229

d6474,"When I ski my legs form an A-frame shape and it doesn't look very nice, how can I fix this?","A-frame can occur due to many reasons, this includes improper boot setup, for example, the cuff alignment is incorrect, or technique issues. It is best to consult an experienced boot fitter to ensure the boot is set up correctly. Once you've ensured the boot is set up correctly, it is likely a technique issue. A common cause of A-frame is a result of rotating the outside knee inside more than the inside knee, and this can happen due to wider skis or wanting to create a bigger edge angle. Ideally, we should avoid over-rotating the knee inside as this creates a weaker position and instead rely on moving the hip and upper body into the inside of the turn to create a bigger edge angle and try to keep the outside leg relatively straight.

A good exercise to practice this is the T-drill, where you try to make sure your outside leg is as straight as possible and create edge angle by leaning your whole body into the turn, you'll need to shorten your inside leg by bringing your need to your chest, which will then still allow you to balance mostly on your straight downhill leg.",dolly,retain,285,0.6523820161819458
d540,How to play a forehead in tennis,"Let's assume you are an adult and a right-hand player:

First, you do split steps, hold the racket with your left hand and put your right hand below your left hand on the racket
Second, when the ball just left the racket of your opponent, you rotate yourself so your body faces the right side of the court. Keep looking at the ball and your body steady in the process. You should bend your legs a little bit to lower your center of gravity.
You should find your racket on the right side of your body, now hold it loosely with your right hand using a semi-western grip, release your left hand and move it in the direction of the incoming ball. At the same time, step out using your left leg so the distance between your legs is a little bit wider than your shoulders, and keep your center of gravity on your right leg.
Now the ball starts to bounce and reach its highest point, you are going to hit the ball. You push your right foot to the ground and move your body weight from bottom to front, lower the racket head, and turn your pelvis from right to left at the same time. All of these powers combine into the force toward the front and your right-hand uses it to pull your racket from back to front and hit the ball right at the sweet point of your racket, keep pushing the racket until it reaches a limit where you cannot push any more and then release your racket and let the racket‘s inertia lead you from right to left. You should keep turning your body from right to left as well as moving your body weight from back to front until you body is fully facing your opponent and your body weight stands on the front of your left foot. Your shoulder will touch your chin if you do it right. your racket will be on the left side of your body without your control.",dolly,retain,416,0.6523934602737427

I do believe it could be the start of so much good at all levels - it would help nations, societies and people to focus on their own and others' happiness --- and make decisions that focus on the larger good. Many of the troubles ailing us as nations would disappear if we just saw the other side and put ourselves in their shoes. Societies would heal if artificially created differences were done away with. And families and relationships would benefit from a better understanding of the other side's point of view. 

In this utopian world filled with empathy and selflessness, no human would die of hunger, no mother would lose her child due to lack of medical facilities and no human would die of self harm because they were not ""normal"" or a part of the mainstream.

It was initially held at the Champ de Mars, and was transferred to Longchamp in 1857. It was cancelled due to the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and was renamed the Grande Poule des Produits in 1872.

The race was one of several trials for the Prix du Jockey Club collectively known as the Poules des Produits. The others (listed by their modern titles) were the Prix Daru, the Prix Hocquart, the Prix Noailles and the Prix Greffulhe. Unlike those races, the Grande Poule des Produits had no restrictions based on the nationality of a horse's sire or dam.

The event was renamed in memory of Auguste Lupin (1807–1895), a successful owner-breeder, in 1896.

The Prix Lupin was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. It was cancelled once during World War II, in 1940. It was run at Le Tremblay over 2,150 metres in 1943, and at Maisons-Laffitte in 1944.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix Lupin was classed at Group 1 level.

d13988,Is Python or Java a better programming language?,"Python and Java are two of the most popular and robust programming languages.  Java is the fifth most commonly used programming language according to Stack Overflow. Java is generally faster and more efficient than Python because it is a compiled language. While it's one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically. However, Python still takes the cake in terms of simplicity. 

 As an interpreted language, Python has simpler, more concise syntax than Java. It can perform the same function as Java in fewer lines of code. Python also offers extensive libraries, especially around data analysis and machine learning. Because it's dynamically typed, it allows for even fast development compared to Java. 

Other key differences include how each handles memory management and the ability to run multiple threads at the same time. 

For example, lets dive into this threading difference. Java fully supports multithreading. When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance. Now if you search the web for threading in Python you might be a bit confused. You will find articles claiming that Python can't support multithreading but then you will also find tutorials and packages for threading and parallel processing. Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. However, it's threading package allows you to speed up I/O bound programs. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.

The answer to which is better is largely dependent on the user and the use case. Before learning one or starting a new project with either, think about what your goals are and decide which one fits those more closely.",dolly,retain,420,0.6529342532157898

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both

Then took the other, as just as fair, 
And having perhaps the better claim 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear, 
Though as for that the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same, 

And both that morning equally lay 
In leaves no step had trodden black.

Yet knowing how way leads on to way 
I doubted if I should ever come back.

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,

d1863,Explain how sampling bias in Voice Of Customer research could adversely affect a marketing analysis of customers' post-purchase experience with a product.,"Recently I bought a TV from Amazon after extensive research and analysis. The TV manufacturer promptly followed up two weeks after the purchase. The post-purchase experience survey had questions like the following: 


·  	Did you buy it from a store/online? 

·  	Are you satisfied with your order? 

·  	Which store did you visit? 

·  	Was the self-assembly instructions easy to follow? 

·  	What other items would you consider purchasing from our brand? 

  
The above questions were too generic from the TV manufacturer, and they missed the mark in identifying me as a persona and my buying criteria. I bought the TV for my basement as a secondary TV, and I picked a TV brand with standard features to be cost-effective. Below are a few sampling biases from the survey 


Buyer’s criteria 

The survey didn’t identify the TV for primary usage. I purchased this as a secondary TV, and my expectations were low, but I’m satisfied with the TV. I wouldn’t have picked this brand if this was my primary TV purchase. This is a classic example of sampling bias where the survey didn’t identify my buying criteria and resulted in skewed results.

d7478,Bikes are very diverse and have different geometries based on your riding styles. For example a road bike will have a forward leaning geometry and a mountain bike will be more upright. Furthermore you will consider the components and parts that are worth paying for. Bikes can be really expensive for features you may or may not use. Consider buying a base frame with the right geometry and then customizing parts like shocks or handlebars for your specific needs. There are many brands that carry stock frames and demoing a few will really help you understand the one that works for your body structure and application.,Local bike shops have a range of bicycle frames and parts. You can ask the knowledgable mechanic or bike groups about recommendations for the kind of riding you'd like to pursue. It's most important to find a bike that works for your body type and size. The highest end bikes won't even be enjoyable if you don't feel confident on that frame geometry.,dolly,retain,228,0.6540401577949524

d11152,"Why is the Cave of the Crystals or Giant Crystal Cave closed to the public? Cave of the Crystals or Giant Crystal Cave (Spanish: Cueva de los cristales) is a cave connected to the Naica Mine at a depth of 300 metres (980 ft), in Naica, Chihuahua, Mexico. It takes the form of a chamber within the limestone host rock of the mine, and is about 109-metre (358 ft) long with a volume of 5,000 to 6,000 cubic metres (180,000 to 210,000 cu ft).

The chamber contains giant selenite crystals (gypsum, CaSO4 · 2 H2O), some of the largest natural crystals ever found. The largest is 11.40 metres (37.4 ft), with a volume of about 5 cubic metres (180 cu ft), and an estimated mass of 12 tonnes. When not flooded, the cave is extremely hot, with air temperatures reaching up to 58 °C (136 °F) with 90 to 99 percent humidity. This is comparable to temperature records in Death Valley, but with much wetter air. The cave is relatively unexplored because of these factors. Without proper protection, people can only endure approximately ten minutes of exposure at a time.

The cave was discovered in April 2000 by brothers Juan and Pedro Sánchez while drilling in the mine. As of October 2015, the mine had reflooded and the cavern filled once more with the water rich in minerals required for the crystals to grow.

A group of scientists in the Naica Project have been studying these caverns.","The conditions in the cave are not hospitable, extreme heat and humidity, sharp slippery crystals are lethal for humans.",dolly,retain,400,0.6543569564819336

They were raised thinking they are the center of the universe. Their moms made them believe they could do no wrong. They never learned how to be considerate of other people's feelings. They learned that no matter what, mama would always be around to clean up their mess — literally and figuratively. Their moms did their laundry well into their twenties. They don't know how to do basic things around the house like boil an egg, cook rice or pick up after themselves. A telltale sign of a mama's boy: he comes home with a new purchase, opens it up, leaves all the plastic packaging lying around on the kitchen table. It doesn't bother him. He literally does not see the trash he leaves around. Mama's boys don't know how to pay their bills, manage their checking accounts, do grocery shopping and many, many more things. But these behaviors are symbolic of a much deeper deficiency: their emotional intelligence is practically nonexistent. Typically, it takes decades to train a mama's boy to be a fully functioning adult who can be an acceptable partner.

High levels of all of these 4 EQ traits are important qualities for a effective managers. Essentially, someone with high EQ is very aware of how they are perceived, but just as importantly, they have an innate ability to discern others' feelings and motivations. Leaders with high EQ are interested in learning about what makes their employees tick, and they are aware that many people have completely different motivations. For example, a manager with high EQ understands that even though they may not personally be motivated primarily by receiving positive feedback, that if someone on their team becomes extremely motivated by praise for a job well done, they must make sure they are regularly delivering the kudos that employee thrives on.

d13242,"Given the following summary of the book ""Human Compatible"" by Stuart Russell, what is the author's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI? Russell begins by asserting that the standard model of AI research, in which the primary definition of success is getting better and better at achieving rigid human-specified goals, is dangerously misguided. Such goals may not actually reflect what human designers intend, such as by failing to take into account any human values not included in the goals. If an AI developed according to the standard model were to become superintelligent, it would likely not fully reflect human values and could be catastrophic to humanity. Russell asserts that precisely because the timeline for developing human-level or superintelligent AI is highly uncertain, safety research should be begun as soon as possible, as it is also highly uncertain how long it would take to complete such research.

Russell argues that continuing progress in AI capability is inevitable because of economic pressures. Such pressures can already be seen in the development of existing AI technologies such as self-driving cars and personal assistant software. Moreover, human-level AI could be worth many trillions of dollars. Russell then examines the current debate surrounding AI risk. He offers refutations to a number of common arguments dismissing AI risk and attributes much of their persistence to tribalism—AI researchers may see AI risk concerns as an ""attack"" on their field. Russell reiterates that there are legitimate reasons to take AI risk concerns seriously and that economic pressures make continued innovation in AI inevitable.

Russell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focuses on deference to humans. Unlike in the standard model of AI, where the objective is rigid and certain, this approach would have the AI's true objective remain uncertain, with the AI only approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world. This uncertainty would, ideally, prevent catastrophic misunderstandings of human preferences and encourage cooperation and communication with humans. Russell concludes by calling for tighter governance of AI research and development as well as cultural introspection about the appropriate amount of autonomy to retain in an AI-dominated world.",Russell suggests that the AIs should be trained in a way that makes them gradually gain knowledge of what is truly beneficial to humans. AIs developed in this fashion would cooperate with humans while leaving them with a high enough level of autonomy.,dolly,retain,507,0.6550461053848267

(People dying of illness are frequently inarticulate at the end, and in such cases their actual last utterances may not be recorded or considered very important.) Last words may be recorded accurately, or, for a variety of reasons, may not. Reasons can include simple error or deliberate intent. Even if reported wrongly, putative last words can constitute an important part of the perceived historical records or demonstration of cultural attitudes toward death at the time.","Sometimes it is, while other times it may contain errors or deliberately misquoted.",dolly,retain,194,0.6566067934036255

If it's resolvable, we need to check that remote service is reachable - we can use tools like ping, traceroute, and related to check that network traffic is routed correctly. If it's not reachable, we need to check if routing is configured correctly and no firewall is blocking traffic between. If remote service is reachable, then we need to check if we can access the specific port on which service is listening - this is usually done with commands like telnet, nc and nmap.

It has many varieties and flavors, but the two most popular varieties are pearl black milk tea and pearl green milk tea (""pearl"" signifies the tapioca balls at the bottom).","Boba tea is a very delicious drink originally from Taiwan.

Concerns have been raised about whether attempts to exempt the multiverse from experimental verification could erode public confidence in science and ultimately damage the study of fundamental physics.

The ability to disprove a theory by means of scientific experiment is a critical criterion of the accepted scientific method. Paul Steinhardt has famously argued that no experiment can rule out a theory if the theory provides for all possible outcomes.,"While there is nothing scientific around the term multiverse, the term has been popularized by science fiction, and conveys the idea that there are many iterations of universes that are tied together, but each in it's own way unique",dolly,retain,207,0.6568912267684937

The main purpose behind business process mapping is to assist organizations in becoming more effective. A clear and detailed business process map or diagram allows outside firms to come in and look at whether or not improvements can be made to the current process.

Business process mapping takes a specific objective and helps to measure and compare that objective alongside the entire organization's objectives to make sure that all processes are aligned with the company's values and capabilities.

International Organization for Standardization or ISO 9001 : 2015 encourages a process approach to quality management. It is important to understand how each process relates to other processes within the organization and how those interactions impact Quality Management.","Business Process Mapping describes the capture of a set of business activities that deliver an outcome.

Not all children are the same, so there is no ""magic bullet"" to calming down a child in a tantrum, but a couple things that can help when your child is having a melt-down:

1. Remember that their feelings are real and they are not trying to manipulate. Young children do not yet have the capacity to manipulate
2. Make sure the space is safe for the child, and any other children around.

d2058,"Given this reference text, what are column stores used for? A column-oriented DBMS or columnar DBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that stores data tables by column rather than by row. Benefits include more efficient access to data when only querying a subset of columns (by eliminating the need to read columns that are not relevant), and more options for data compression. However, they are typically less efficient for inserting new data.

Practical use of a column store versus a row store differs little in the relational DBMS world. Both columnar and row databases can use traditional database query languages like SQL to load data and perform queries. Both row and columnar databases can become the backbone in a system to serve data for common extract, transform, load (ETL) and tools.",A column store database stores data as any other database management system.

d1343,What's the best way to potty train a puppy?,"You just adopted a puppy, congratulations!  There are many methods to successfully house-train or potty-train puppies.  First, it's important to remain patient and diligent around maintaining a strict schedule for feeding, rest, play and potty times.  This should start the  moment your puppy arrives as this is going to set them and you up for success.  Second, when accidents happen, which will occur for the first few weeks, remember to be patient and kind to your puppy.  This will develop a deep sense of trust in you as the authority figure in the home.  

Generally, puppies need to be let outside to go potty outside within a secure area after waking, playtime and after every meal.  It's important not to confuse potty time with playtime and that your puppy is placed safely in a crate or gated area if they aren't being watched closely.   

How do you know when your puppy needs to go potty?  

Most puppies will begin sniffing the ground when they need to go potty so if you witness this happening indoors, quickly usher your puppy outside or to a training pad.  It's important to provide your puppy a lot of praise for a job well done.  For some puppies, verbal praise from their family member while providing them with a small treat will help your puppy make the connection that going potty in the appropriate area is a very good thing for them and for you.",dolly,retain,342,0.6588454246520996
d9726,Write a short story (under 250 words) about meditation. The narrator should be uncomfortable.,"Our guide asks us to close our eyes and softly leads us through a meditation: we’re in a meadow, leaning against an old tree. The trunk supports us as we become one with the earth, anchoring ourselves in place, feeling at peace.

She gives us a mantra: “I am…” and we fill in the blank and silently repeat the statement in our minds.  

“I am human,” I think to myself as I visualize myself becoming one with the tree, growing roots and hardening, knowing I will eventually be chopped down along with the other trees that must have once been in this lonely meadow. 

When our guide softly brings us back to reality she encourages us to share our “I am” mantras and I panic as the other participants declare: “I am brave.” “I am enough.” “I am still.” 

I don’t repeat my mantra. I don’t want to explain why I needed to feel human, how I saw myself transforming into not only the tree, but then a sprite, a creature of the forest.

“I am okay,” I whisper. My declaration is met with universal head nodding.

d7869,"How many people are needed to perform the Turing test? The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.","You need two people: one person is the conversation partner to the machine.

d8169,What makes a good cocktail?,"There are many elements to a good cocktail, and these can often be modified to fit individual tastes. In general, a cocktail contains a base spirit, flavors from bitters or amaros, and something to sweeten. There are optional ingredients to add as well, like fruit, juice, or herbs. 

The amount of each ingredient can vary the flavor significantly, so it is important to understand the impact of each ingredient. For example, very strong flavors like bitters or absinthe should be used in very small quantities. Sometimes even a rinse in the cocktail glass or spritz on the top of the prepared cocktail is enough to add the desired amount of flavor.

A good cocktail comes about from a balance in flavors that build and develop off one another. The deep wooden flavor in whiskey is brightened by the citrus twist of an old fashioned. The sweetness from pineapple juice is deepened by the bitterness of campari in a jungle bird. The bitterness of ginger syrup is balanced with the tartness of lemon juice in a penicillin. 

Many newer cocktails are spins off a classic. Each builds off a flavor profile and modifies some of the more subtle flavors therein. If one wants to experiment with creating a new cocktail, starting with a classic favorite could be a good place to start. 

It is also possible to create the same balanced flavors without the use of spirits (or with the use of alcohol free spirits).",dolly,retain,329,0.6590110063552856

d6038,How do I get better at the game of golf?,"Golf is a game that originated in the 15th century, and to this day, is still being iterated on.  Although there have been many different swing styles over the years, there are fundamentals to playing the game that when followed, have produced the most successful golfers. 

Building a strong golf foundation using 4 key principles is key to improving at the game of golf which are: aligning your expectations to reality, applying an effective on course strategy, practicing correctly, and, building a sharp mental game.

By aligning your expectations to the reality of how you are playing, you allow your mind to accept the good with the bad which allows for a more free and easy playing style, often leading to better play.

Applying an effective course strategy will allow you to score better as you know where you can make up strokes on your competitors.  For example, driving distance off the tee paired with greens in regulation play a crucial role in scoring, as opposed to putting whereas you have a 20 foot putt compared to a 40 foot putt, your make percentages are both low.

Learning how to practice correctly can also improve your on course scoring as most approach practice incorrectly.  Zombie range sessions have become the norm, but rarely in golf do you have the same shot twice in a row.  Implement that same theory on the driving range so you have more of a feel of what on course play will feel like.

Finally, in order to improve your scoring, you need to build a sharp mental game while you play.  This includes visualizing your shot before you hit it, being able to clear your head of all unwanted thoughts other than the shot you want to hit, and implementing a pre shot routine that is easily replicable.

By applying these core 4 strategies, you should see your golf scores decrease without any significant change in your actual swing.",dolly,retain,424,0.6602214574813843

For a vacation in a city, you can’t beat Paris.  There is a large range of available cuisine, from inexpensive bistros and cafes, to very expensive, Michelin starred restaurants.  It is hard to get a bad meal in Paris.  The sightseeing also is impressive, with modern architecture combined with classic structures, and many museums to fill your days. Getting around Paris is very easy, as it is a very walkable city and also has an efficient and relatively inexpensive public transportation system.  

For a lake vacation, Lake Como is wonderful, and in particular Bellagio, which is widely regarded as the prettiest village in Lake Como.  Getting to Bellagio is fairly easy, as it’s close to Milan.  The food is reasonably priced, although it’s generally northern Italian food (with limited options for other ethnic food).  Transportation around the lake is convenient with an efficient ferry service on Lake Como, although getting into the individual villages can be a bit challenging given the hills (so expect to walk!).  Many villages near Bellagio are also very quaint, and within walking distance – you’ll definitely get good exercise going from village to village.

For a seaside vacation, Dubrovnik is a great choice.  It’s not so convenient to get there from the United States, especially for those in the western United States since there are no direct flights.  However, it’s well worth the trip.  This walled city is jaw dropping beautiful.  The people are among the friendliest in Europe.

d10804,How can I change a bad habit?,"Each habit has a trigger event, an action you subconsciously take after the trigger event happens, and the reward that make you keep following the same habit. When you say a habit is bad, it actually means the action you take after the trigger event is something you do not want to keep doing.

An effective way to make changes is to replace the action to something different. To make this alternative action effective, this action will need to also produce the reward that your brain is seeking for. 

In order to find an effective alternative action, you will need to understand what is your trigger and what is the reward. 

Figuring out the trigger is the first step. You can try to think about what happened when you started to take actions. One way to find the pattern is to write down what happened. Then, you can look at them to find the pattern. 

Once you find out the trigger, you can try to remind you to change your action after experiencing the trigger event. With your changed action, you will be able to gradually figure out the reward hidden in your old habit. Some actions will not give you the satisfying feeling like old time. After some try-and-error, you can likely tell the new action that actually gives you the same satisfying feeling. Then, you can keep following the new action. Essentially, this new action helps you form the new habit, which suppress the old habit. 

Finally, please note that when you are having extra stress, you may find it is harder to follow the new habit and start to worry about picking up the old habit again. Please trust yourself to keep the new habit. You faith will help you push through difficult situations.",dolly,retain,383,0.6608544588088989

But for many, suffering can come to dominate their lives, due to abuse, the loss of loved ones, difficult relationships, mental illnesses, or disability. By finding meaning in ones life, the hard times full of suffering can be tempered with hope: for a better life for your children, for a better world, or a better after-life. Without finding something to give your life meaning, you risk falling into nihilism, anger, and despair. And those feelings tend to set you on a self-reinforcing path, and drag others down with you. While people often start looking for meaning in their lives when they encounter suffering to explain that suffering, it is in embracing a purpose that you can find hope and reduce the suffering in the world.",dolly,retain,215,0.660930871963501

d1679,"What is the meaning of Life, The Universe, and Everything?","This topic has been discussed in debt by Theologians, philosophers, and scientists throughout the course of human history.  While most observations about the universe leave the question unanswered the broad strokes are as follows.

Theologians state in many religions that there is an organizing force known as God providing direction to the universe.  Humans that best align with this organizing force or God are guaranteed good fortune in this life or after.  There are variations in humans level of involvement in this process with Christianity requiring a savior (Jesus) for people to enter the afterlife vs achieving a higher state of consciousness in this life or through reincarnation.

Philosophers differ on the meaning of life with predominate views following down the lines of seeking your own fulfillment or the fulfillment of others.  Seeking your own fulfillment has been a major component of capitalism, self-preservation, and risk taking that lead to new discoveries in Science and Technology.  Seeking the fulfillment of others has lead to great advancements in philanthropy, equality, and the general well being of society.  This ""social compact"" insures stability and provides an expectation that harmful activities like Murder, Robbery, etc are discouraged and punished.

Scientists view this question through the lens of the observable universe.  As such efforts have been made to create a ""unifying theory of everything"" to show some understandable order to the universe.  Others have focused their study on the improbability of how humans could have been created in a universe with seemingly random and infinite chance.  Some scientists have conceded that the question is something Science is ill-fitted to answer.

First you need to describe your team and your role on the team, so the committee understands your context. For example, being the tech lead of Amazing Service for the past 2 years.

Second you need to describe the biggest accomplishments in recent years, typically up to 5. For example, launched Amazing Service or improved SLA from 3 9s to 4 9s.

Next you need to show your actual work closely matches the requirements of the next level. For example, designed and built the security system for Amazing Service, or hired and managed the Amazing Service team, or initiated Amazing Service and grew it to $100M ARR.

The above points are your promo rationale, which should be the focus of your packet. The rest of the packet is to provide verifiable evidence to your rationale.

d14377,"Why do we have a threefold repetition rule in chess? In chess, the threefold repetition rule states that a player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times during the game. The rule is also known as repetition of position and, in the USCF rules, as triple occurrence of position. Two positions are by definition ""the same"" if the same types of pieces occupy the same squares, the same player has the move, the remaining castling rights are the same and the possibility to capture en passant is the same. The repeated positions need not occur in succession. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely.

The game is not automatically drawn if a position occurs for the third time – one of the players, on their turn, must claim the draw with the arbiter. The claim must be made either before making the move which will produce the third repetition, or after the opponent has made a move producing a third repetition. By contrast, the fivefold repetition rule requires the arbiter to intervene and declare the game drawn if the same position occurs five times, needing no claim by the players.",This rule is to ensure the game ends and does not continue indefinitely.,dolly,retain,295,0.6627251505851746

d118,Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,"While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

So then why Georgia?  Georgia currently provides one of the highest incentive structures at 20% with minimal restrictions on talent and a very low minimum budget of $500,000.",dolly,retain,317,0.6633305549621582

A language is not only a way to communicate, it transmits also tradition, culture, emotions, mindset and many other habits that are typical in a specific country. Parents should not mix languages as children need to learn that a specific person has to be addressed in a specific language, otherwise they learn that languages can be mixed. The passive skills are always bigger than the active language skills, don't give up too early! They will make use of their passive language skills at some point. It is easier to learn languages if you also listen to music, watch movies in different languages and have friends that speak those languages. Remember that every person is different. Even if you raise different kids the same way, some of them might learn languages easier than others.

d9943,Why do home power outages occur?,"Power outages can occur for a number of reasons. First, some perceived ""outages"" may actually be caused by overloading a circuit breaker in a home. To eliminate this as a possibility and confirm the issue is not localized to your home, check to make sure that all circuits in your electric panel are still on. 

If you are experiencing a power outage, it may been caused by a few different reasons:
- Power safety shutoff: in some situations, a power provider will de-electrify an area to prevent issues. This might be due to maintenance activities with employees working on a section of the power grid, or to prevent issues in inclimate weather, such as preventing wildfire ignition in high-wind events. 
- Weather-caused issues: high wind or ice-storms can sometimes snap power lines or cause tree limbs to fall. 

Check with your utility provider to stay up to date on any outage you are experiencing. Most utilities provide SMS/text updates, which will keep you updated in case you lose access to the internet (as your home router requires power too!)",dolly,retain,264,0.6638690829277039
d9292,What is detection engineering and what are the benefits?,"Detection engineering is a new approach to threat detection. More than just writing detection rules, detection engineering is a process—applying systems thinking and engineering to more accurately detect threats. The goal is to create an automated system of threat detection which is customizable, flexible, repeatable, and produces high quality alerts for security teams to act upon. Detection engineering is not yet a mature discipline with consistent methods and predictable results, but pioneers in the field are working towards this goal. There is not a lot written about the concept right now, no go-to standards or frameworks. It appears companies are developing their own approaches to incorporate the concept to improve their detection and response capabilities. 

A concept called detection-as-code (DaC), first coined by Anton Chuvakin in 2020, is at the heart of detection engineering, and points to the idea that detections should be treated as code. Essentially, it is about applying software engineering best practices to detections using modern agile CI/CD processes. 

The benefits Of Detection Engineering include 1) reduced mean-time-to-response through automation of detections, 2) detections are more relevant to the environment, 3) the process is structured, repeatable, and informs workflows, 4) detection rules and analytics are version controlled, reused, and modified as needed, 5) Peer review and automated testing are part of the process, to catch mistakes and gaps.",dolly,retain,327,0.663881778717041

My suggestion to those who are socially isolated will be to try to get yourself out of your comfort zone. Go to meetup.com to find people who like to do similar activities like you and join them.

d14900,What is the experience of Microsoft Office users moving to Google Docs?,"Microsoft Office has been an enterprise software of choice for over 2 decades.  Long term users have seen Office evolve from its early days when it was installed on Windows machines to the relatively new Office 365 that is deployed online.  The key products in the Microsoft Office suite used by enterprises have been Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Google Docs is also an enterprise offering that consists of Docs, Sheets and Slides - these map to the corresponding Microsoft Office suite products listed.  Users who have been on Microsoft Office for many years find the move to Google Docs difficult.  This is because the commands across Google Docs are quite different to Office and one needs to spend time searching for MS office equivalent commands.  For example, the keyboard shortcut command to insert a freeze pane in windows excel is not the same in Google Sheets.  Formulae in cells and data analysis in Sheets is also different in sheets when compared to Excel. While it takes some time to unlearn commands and learn new ones as one moves from Microsoft Office to Google Docs, once one has spent some time working with Google Docs it starts to get easier.  And features such as ease of collaboration, never losing any content ever again, being able to work on the go from anywhere become the norm.  In summary, a user who has worked on Office for many years may find it difficult in the beginning but users who start with Google Docs will be comfortable from the beginning.",dolly,retain,338,0.6642115712165833
d13829,Why do some countries outperform other countries in certain sports despite having a smaller population?,"A country's success in a given sport at the international level will depend on a number of factors other than population alone. While a country's population is a good identifier for the total selection pool for high performing athletes to come from, it is one of many factors. A country's founding history, climate zone, and GDP are other notable factors in sport performance. 

A nations history plays factor as many sports are baked in centuries of tradition. For example, Cricket, which is believed to have originated in England is most popular in countries that were originally British Colonies. Long traditions such as this set specific sports into the culture of a nation, increasing the percentage of the athlete pool that it can pull from and can increase the level at which that nation is competitive. 

Climate zone can also influence the competitiveness of a country in given sports. Norway, fore example, earned the most olympic medals of any country in the 2022 olympic games with a total of 37 medals. In the summer games of 2020 (held in 2021), Norway ranked 20th overall with just 8 medals. Norways Climate and Topography have led winter sports to be extremely popular, and Norway has over time developed elite programs in cross country/nordic skiing, speed skating, curling, biathlon, and ski jumping. 

A nations wealth will also influence performance in sport at the international level. This occurs predominantly for two reasons. First is that more money enables larger budgets on equipment, coaching, player development, participation in international circuits, data insights, medical staff etc. that over time create a performance separation from those who can not afford these things. Second is access to sports, many sports are quite expensive some examples include snow sports, gymnastics, swimming, hockey, and polo. Nations which can not afford to provide the facilities or support to develop athletes will often fail to draw a large talent pool and not be competitive at the international level.",dolly,retain,449,0.6642196178436279

d13461,"Summarize the following paragraph about modern fighter jets Currently the cutting edge of fighter design, fifth-generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. They have multifunction AESA radars with high-bandwidth, low-probability of intercept (LPI) data transmission capabilities. The infra-red search and track sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced avionics, glass cockpits, helmet-mounted sights (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor data fusion for vastly improved situational awareness while easing the pilot's workload. Avionics suites rely on extensive use of very high-speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed data buses. Overall, the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth-generation fighters with a ""first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability"".","Fifth-generation fighter jets take advantage of variety of technological advancements, new materials and design principals to give pilots comprehensive, early visibility of all potential threats while minimizing their own detectability.",dolly,retain,353,0.6649848818778992

Walter builds a moving arm mount for an M60 machine gun that he can activate from the car's remote key fob, and places it in the trunk of a car that he got from the same gun dealer.  Walter then drives to the compound where the Aryan Brotherhood are living, under a trick that he can help them make “meth” with a new recipe.

Once inside, Walter Argues with Jack about why Jessie isn’t dead yet, causing the angry Jack to bring Jessie into the room to prove they are not friends.  AT this point, Walter charges Jessie to the floor and presses the key fob, causing the M60 to begin shooting into the building.

Everyone in the building is shot dead except for Jessie, Walter, Todd and Jack.  Jesse strangles Todd to death with his handcuffs, and Walter Shoots Jack with his own gun.  Jessie then leaves the compound in one of the cars that is sitting outside.

After this, you become aware that Walter was hit by a ricochet while the M60 was firing, and has effectively been shot in the stomach.

d12537,What are the benefits of ranked voting?,"In elections for political office, ranked voting allows second, third and lower preference choices to be given weight in the event a voter's higher ranked choices do not show the electoral strength necessary to win a given election. In this way, overall social utility is maximized in the sense that the optimal level of voter happiness will be achieved. Ranked voting will give centrist and more moderate candidates and parties a greater chance to succeed in elections, reducing the power of the extreme elements on both sides of the political spectrum. It will encourage more moderate candidates to step forward and more moderate third parties to form. The extreme partisanship currently existing in politics will be mitigated. Donald Trump would likely not have won the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 because, although he had a very committed backing of a large minority of Republican voters, he faced a divided field of more moderate and traditional candidates who split the more rational majority of the party. Trump would likely not have been the second choice for many of the backers of other candidates. A more moderate candidate would likely have emerged as the eventual nominee. Opponents of ranked voting cite possible complexity and greater threat of computerized hacking or errors impacting election results. Entrenched politicians of both major parties oppose ranked voting because they do not want to encourage the formation of centrist third parties that could jeopardize the standing of their parties and their own political careers.",dolly,retain,321,0.6650885939598083

Machine Learning is relatively less concerned with identifying the specific relations between the involved variables. For example, uncovering the nature of the underlying functions or the specific types of interactive, multivariate dependencies between variables are not the main goal of machine learning. Instead, the focus is on producing a solution that can generate useful predictions. Machine Learning accepts among others a ""black box"" type approach to data exploration or knowledge discovery and uses not only the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, but also such techniques as Neural Networks which can generate valid predictions but are not capable of identifying the specific nature of the interrelations between the variables on which the predictions are based.",dolly,retain,232,0.6651342511177063

d10462,"What is ""woke"" and why is it so controversial?","Woke is a general political term used to group a set of similar ideologies in an attempt to characterize the political motivations typically ascribed to the far left. Although many definitions of woke exist, these definitions run along a few common threads. Woke is typically used to describe the ideals underpinning what is known as equality of outcome. This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.

Those who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.

Wokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism.

d11851,Is there a correlation between the milestones required between Data AI/ML and Intelligent Automation (RPA) value curve over time?,"For organizations to achieve the most value from their data, they must establish a data foundation that allows for high-quality reporting on past events. Establishing a Databrick’s Lakehouse foundation requires no AI/ML capabilities. Then, over time, use that data AI/ML to drive automated decisions for crucial business processes.  For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the “value curve” for both data and intelligent automation. 
The value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today. Then, as you mature your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, your automation(s) need to expand to include simple document understanding AI.  Extracting data from the same form hundreds or thousands of times is a good example. Finally, for any organization to gain the highest value and ROI for their intelligent automation investments, using complex AI/ML to produce automated decisions for digital workers (unattended automation) enables exceptionally complex, long-running automation to be successfully developed, put into production, and maintained over time.

In summary, think of “AI/ML” as the thinking and “Intelligent Automation” as the doing. The value of both Data and RPA to any organization grows exponentially over time as they develop their ability to apply to complex AI/ML such that those models deliver trusted automated decisions to the digital workforce running complex automation.",dolly,retain,345,0.6658391952514648
d13670,Write about the potential ethical concerns of de-identification techniques.,"One of the ethical issues associated with the technique of suppression is the further underrepresentation of historically underrepresented groups. For example, within the MOOC dataset there exists only one row affiliated with a user from Antartica (continent). Similarly, the following countries have also appeared once or twice only in the entire dataset: San Marino, Falkland Islands, and Brunei. Geographically underrepresented, these pieces of information would get entirely eliminated under the suppression technique. This presents an ethical paradox: on one hand, we wish to preserve k-anonymity and protect the privacy of users from underrepresented regions; on the other hand, to reach that goal we would have to erase their existence in the dataset and further reinforce the pre-existing underrepresentation. Another example would be the column of the year of birth. The MOOCs user population are overrepresented by young people, whereas users over 80 years old only take a proportion less than 1% in the entire dataset. In particular, if we were to use the suppression technique to achieve k-anonymity, almost every piece of information associated with users over 80 years old would have to be discarded. Again, the elderly have been historically underrepresented in the industry of education, yet by using suppression, we protect their privacy at the expense of representation.

This loss of representation as a result of suppression is detrimental at multiple aspects and therefore deserves attention. As the MOOCs platform is deprived of relevant information on these users, the company will lose sight of the potential demand that these underrepresented groups have for online education, thereby failing to reach them through marketing and advertisement. Besides straining the platform’s user base and profitability, this would worsen the situation that the underrepresented groups have limited resources to online education. Moreover, inferences on the suppressed dataset could reinforce the societal bias that certain groups of people are not open to education – such as the elderly – whereas the reality is simply that we erase the information on the elderly who actively engage in online education platforms. As a result, the elderly could feel themselves further distanced from the mainstream media and technology. Therefore, using suppression alone to achieve k-anonymity within a dataset, while effective, could be complicated by the ethical issue of underrepresentation.",dolly,retain,501,0.6658878922462463

d6222,Why do people get sore after working out?,"Muscle soreness occurs because muscle and the connective tissue around it get damaged during exercise, such as weight lifting or high intensity training. This kind of natural breakdown is natural and needed for muscle growth, since muscle grows back stronger during the body's repair process. During this process the affected muscle fibers increase in strength and thickness. 

Additionally, people tend to experience lactic acid buildup prior to exercise as your body uses oxygen to convert glucose to energy. During exercise, if there is a lack of oxygen for this process, you may produce a substance called lactate. Many people believe that soreness comes from the buildup of this lactic acid, but the real contributor is the breakdown of muscle from usage.",dolly,retain,188,0.6659154891967773
d6329,What is the genomics of disease?,"With the advent of next-generation sequencing we are obtaining enough sequence data to map the genes of complex diseases including infertility, breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Genome-wide association studies are a useful approach to pinpoint the mutations responsible for such complex diseases. Through these studies, thousands of DNA variants have been identified that are associated with similar diseases and traits. Furthermore, the possibility for genes to be used at prognosis, diagnosis or treatment is one of the most essential applications. Many studies are discussing both the promising ways to choose the genes to be used and the problems and pitfalls of using genes to predict disease presence or prognosis.

Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of common genetic variants for complex diseases and traits; however, these common variants only explain a small fraction of heritability. Rare variants may account for some of the missing heritability. Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies have rapidly sequenced millions of whole genomes, and such studies have identified hundreds of millions of rare variants. Functional annotations predict the effect or function of a genetic variant and help to prioritize rare functional variants, and incorporating these annotations can effectively boost the power of genetic association of rare variants analysis of whole genome sequencing studies. Some tools have been developed to provide all-in-one rare variant association analysis for whole-genome sequencing data, including integration of genotype data and their functional annotations, association analysis, result summary and visualization. Meta-analysis of whole genome sequencing studies provides an attractive solution to the problem of collecting large sample sizes for discovering rare variants associated with complex phenotypes.",dolly,retain,349,0.6659306287765503

d2120,"What is a personality test? The origins of personality assessment date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through phrenology, the measurement of bumps on the human skull, and physiognomy, which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances. Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary. Galton's list was eventually refined by Louis Leon Thurstone to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time. Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors. This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by Raymond Cattell (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century—based on the peer-reviewed journal literature), who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors. Of the many introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) However, the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.","Personality test is a test of measuring human personality constructs.

The biggest ones, present until now in Giza, are built with astonishing precision using the rudimental tools and materials that were available at that time. For example, Khufu pyramid, culminating at 481 feet, is an architectural masterpiece. The size, orientation and precision of this pyramid are keeping the best current architects agape. However, the journey was not straightforward for ancient Egyptians. Building such megalithic structures remains very hard to even nowadays. Before achieving the precision of the pyramids on Giza plateau, some inconsistencies and simpler trials are still present in Egypt showing the progressive improvement in their construction know-how through time. The first historically documented pyramid in Egypt is attributed to Djozer pharaoh in the third dynastic period. It is a stepped structure with superposed squares without big attention to the external design and polishment that we find later in the more recent pyramids.

Traditional lug and tension rod drums use a drum key and require more attention to detail. For these drums, start by getting all tension rods finger-tight. Bring the snare drum up to tension with a full turn of a drum key of each one, moving in a star pattern around the drum. Use a drumstick to tap around the drum by each tension rod and listen for a consistent sound. 

Once you have the overall sound in the range you’re looking for, test the pitch by tapping around the drum. For the snare’s resonant head, detune it like the batter head. Tune it ‘tabletop tight’: so flat you could confidently rest a drink on it (don’t do this, though). Bring up each tension rod another quarter turn. You want to hear the wires, but not so much that it overwhelms the attack.

Ratemaking, typically carried out through ""rate cases"" before a public utilities commission, serves as one of the primary instruments of government regulation of public utilities.","The price of a utility's products and services will affect its consumption. As with most demand curves, a price increase decreases demand. Through a concept known as rate design or rate structure, regulators set the prices (known as ""rates"" in the case of utilities) and thereby affect the consumption. With declining block rates, the per-unit price of utility consumption decreases as the energy consumption increases. Typically a declining block rate is offered only to very large consumers.

d10373,Why is skiing a great sport?,"Skiing is a fun and enjoyable sport or hobby for many reasons.  For many skiers their first memories of skiing are as a kid with their parents, and brings forward fond childhood memories of snow days, hot chocolate and being outdoors.  But what makes skiing so wonderful is that is blends both individual pursuits and as a group activity.  It is a fun activity to do with a group where all the participants are experiencing the outdoors and the trails together.  At the same time, each skier is dependent on their own skills to get down the trail, thereby providing the individual to have their own challenges and experience while spending time with friends or family.  

Skiing offers the opportunity to enjoy the natural wonders of the mountains and experience breathtaking views.  Every day brings different conditions the skier has to adjust to; visibility, temperature, snow conditions.  These all factor into how the skier is going to ski the terrain, which in-turn provides variety to skiing, even if you are visiting the same mountain and skiing the same trails.  

Skiing is known for having a communal type of culture.  Getting on a chair lift with a stranger can often times lead to great conversations, all be it short ones, the chair lift can be a time to connect with other skiers to learn what trails are offering the best conditions, or what areas of the mountain to avoid.  Skiers often look out for one another on the slopes to ensure others are safe if someone falls.

The exhilaration of speeding down snow packed trail, with views of the mountains and valleys around you, or through the quite of snow capped trees, enjoying time with friends or family, makes skiing one of the best sports people of all ages can enjoy; from little kids to people in their 60's, 70's and even 80's can still enjoy.",dolly,retain,419,0.6699163913726807

d2890,"Is figure skating a hard sport? Figure skating is a sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games, when contested at the 1908 Olympics in London. The Olympic disciplines are men's singles, women's singles,[note 1] pair skating, and ice dance; the four individual disciplines are also combined into a team event, first included in the Winter Olympics in 2014. The non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (the short program and the free skate), which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.

Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior) at local, regional, sectional, national, and international competitions. The International Skating Union (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. These include the Winter Olympics, the World Championships, the World Junior Championships, the European Championships, the Four Continents Championships, the Grand Prix series (senior and junior), and the ISU Challenger Series.

The sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally conclude with exhibition galas, in which the top skaters from each discipline perform non-competitive programs. Many skaters, both during and after their competitive careers, also skate in ice shows, which run during the competitive season and the off-season.","Figure skating is one of the most difficult sports due to a number of reasons, including the precision needed to execute tricks, talent for performing required, and the costs involved in competing. The skill needed to perform tricks like the axel or double axel is already very high  and on top of that, figure skaters need to be good at performing their routines.

Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis on spin relative to other ball sports, which can heavily affect the ball's trajectory.

d14996,What is geomorphometry?,"Geomorphometry, or geomorphometrics, is the science and practice of measuring the characteristics of terrain, the shape of the surface of the Earth, and the effects of this surface form on human and natural geography. It gathers various mathematical, statistical and image processing techniques that can be used to quantify morphological, hydrological, ecological and other aspects of a land surface. Common synonyms for geomorphometry are geomorphological analysis (after geomorphology), terrain morphometry, terrain analysis, and land surface analysis. Geomorphometrics is the discipline based on the computational measures of the geometry, topography and shape of the Earth's horizons, and their temporal change. This is a major component of geographic information systems (GIS) and other software tools for spatial analysis.

In simple terms, geomorphometry aims at extracting (land) surface parameters (morphometric, hydrological, climatic etc.) and objects (watersheds, stream networks, landforms etc.) using input digital land surface model (also known as digital elevation model, DEM) and parameterization software.[Extracted surface parameters and objects can then be used, for example, to improve mapping and modelling of soils, vegetation, land use, geomorphological and geological features and similar.

With the rapid increase of sources of DEMs today (and especially due to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and LIDAR-based projects), extraction of land surface parameters is becoming more and more attractive to numerous fields ranging from precision agriculture, soil-landscape modelling, climatic and hydrological applications to urban planning, education and space research. The topography of almost all Earth has been today sampled or scanned, so that DEMs are available at resolutions of 100 m or better at global scale. Land surface parameters are today successfully used for both stochastic and process-based modelling, the only remaining issue being the level of detail and vertical accuracy of the DEM.",dolly,retain,425,0.6711175441741943

At a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. 

However, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. 

So, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals.

On the negative end, it has fostered division between people with differing opinions, used as a means to spread misinformation, contributed to self-esteem issues stemming from mischaracterization of life and contributed towards productivity loss.

In summary, it is safe to conclude that the benefits of social media outdo its negative impact.",dolly,retain,152,0.67234867811203

d13726,"What is Autism and how varied is the spectrum? The autism spectrum, often referred to as just autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or sometimes autism spectrum condition (ASC), identifies a loosely defined cluster of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by challenges in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and often repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Other common features include unusual responses to sensory stimuli and a preference for sameness or unusual adherence to routines.
Autism is generally understood to be a spectrum disorder, as it can manifest differently in each person: any autistic individual is likely to show some, but not all, of the characteristics associated with it, and the person may exhibit them to varying degrees and frequencies.There is large variation in the support needs of autistic people, and some are nonspeaking, while others have proficient spoken language.","Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that is generally thought to cover a broad and deep spectrum, manifesting very differently from one person to another. Some have high support needs, may be non-speaking, and experience developmental delays; this is more likely with other co-existing diagnoses. Others have relatively low support needs; they may have more typical speech-language and intellectual skills but atypical social/conversation skills, narrowly focused interests, and wordy, pedantic communication.They may still require significant support in some areas of their lives. The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running from mild to severe, but instead means that autism can present very differently in each individual.How a person presents can depend on context, and may vary over time.",dolly,retain,353,0.6732918620109558

Whatever the reasons,  the feeling at the end of every night is one of utter exhaustion, where presumably this feeling is now your life, and will be so forever.  But, in that exhaustion, it can be hard to either notice or truly appreciate beautiful little moments simultaneously occurring.

A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery.

Many hikes are considered dangerous due to their steep pitches and exposure to the elements, while others can be considered dangerous due to less activity and poor trail blazing, such as bushwhacks. Other factors such as inclement weather can dramatically increase the danger of even a moderate hike. Proper preparedness, familiarity of the trails, understanding of incoming weather patterns and communicating your plans and timing to another person helps reduce risk in hiking the White Mountains, but one always assumes some degree of risk. A simple sprained ankle can mean life or death in bad weather, as the White Mountains, and notably the Presidential Range and Mount Washington, are notorious for life-threatening weather. Combined with very exposed routes and lack of safety equipment, even the most experienced hikers have fallen victim to the White Mountains. For experienced hikers seeking more adventurous routes, one might refer to the popular list ""The  Terrifying 25"" which provides a list of routes that have steep inclines, a lot of exposure, fun ladders and caves, among other features.

When she arrived back into the fungi's domain, she saw something breathtaking as she explored. Everywhere she had gone, a ripple of colors seemed to have formed.

Western music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.

Western music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart.

As a person who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past, I have a handful of suggestion to provide. I would suggest not to force the person into any of these things. Give them these suggestions and let them decide for themselves. Let them know you are there to help them for anything they need.
1. Meditate daily: When you start meditation, it seems useless. But overtime, you start feeling the benefits. For some people it takes days, for some months. But just learn to sit in peace with yourself.
2. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with: I went through 3-4 therapists and therapy styles till I found the right one. And I wouldn't want it any other way. I used to think therapy is useless, but now I swear by it.
3. Set time aside in the day to stress: For example, I used to set aside 8 PM to stress. When I would feel anxious about something I could not control, I would just tell myself that I will think about it at 8 PM. It takes practice but it helps.
4. Go outdoors or find a hobby group: As much as I love my bed and TV, just getting myself out there between people helped me so much. I would recommend it for everyone. Being in introvert, I used to hate being around new people. Now I just put myself out there and I know people almost everywhere I go for my hobbies.
5. It's ok to take medication. If anxiety and depression are spoiling your quality of life, it's ok to speak to a psychiatrist and see if they can recommend any medication. It almost was taboo growing up for me, but now I see the benefits.
6. Talk your partners / close friends and express your feelings. Take support from people around you. If they know you are struggling, they will be sensitive enough to help you out.
Hope this helps.",dolly,retain,443,0.6753185391426086

One must must be judicious in the quantity of ingredients while ensuring proper coverage to ensure each bite is equal to the one before and after it. Here, both measurement and distribution of ingredients serves as the scientific aspect of constructing your delicious and timeless lunchtime meal. Jars of peanut utter suggest a serving size as 2 tablespoons, which, when applied to the critical soft white bread, may prove too much to hold and cause soak through or tearing of the bread. We think 1.5 tablespoons is the proper amount to ensure there is coverage of the bread slice to the crust without compromising the integrity of the bread. Jelly application is even more precarious, as it holds more fluid and can soak through the bread quicker; equally, jelly has a tendency to congeal. To ensure proper application, heat the jar of jelly closer to room temperature if refrigerated, then apply using a clean butter knife or small spatula. Again, one must ensure it reaches to the crust and is evenly distributed. Once you have complete coverage of peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, place the peanut butter side of the first slice on top of the upward-facing jelly slice. This ensure none of the jelly slips or drips. Once together, gently compress the sandwich. Slice delicately from one corner to the opposite corner.

3. The data lake table format is the most important component of a lakehouse architecture. There must be some way to organize and manage all the raw data files in the data lake storage. Table formats help abstract the physical data structure’s complexity and allow different engines to work simultaneously on the same data. The table format in a lakehouse architecture facilitates the ability to do data warehouse-level transactions (DML) along with ACID guarantees. Some of the other critical features of a table format are schema evolution, expressive SQL, time travel, data compaction (ie Delta Lake).

d6821,Why is Alien the greatest space horror film of all time?,"For one thing, it does a fantastic job of making the crew of the Nostromo relatable and human. We spend a lot of time with them before any seriously suspenseful or horrific things happen. We understand they're a tight crew, and care about each other, and that they already feel some animosity towards the mining company that sent them out into space. This makes it a lot more scary and sad when eventually most of them become prey to the alien.

Secondly, the main villain in Alien is not only way scarier than almost any other creature villain ever made, the way they build up both her backstory and her eventual full reveal is amazing. When we first see the small chestburster alien, neither we nor the crew have any idea how big, terrifying, and lethal she will become. From her sticky, slick sheen to her cunning and silent hunting skills, she is truly an unstoppable force. If I were trapped on a spaceship with that creature, I don't know what I'd do.

And finally, Alien just feels more ""real"" with its universal and timely themes of greed and fear of the unknown. There are numerous actual stories of mining companies betraying their field employees and endangering their lives for a quick buck; isolated teams of workers going crazy,  suffering from unseen maladies, and falling into chaos and disarray; and of course, the tale of predator and prey is perhaps the oldest one of all.

Climate change has caused stronger winds to occur in SF Bay Area. These strong gusts, some of which can be over 60 mph, are causing large, historic trees to fall onto houses threatening costly real estate as well as peoples lives. In the city of Palo Alto, California Oaks and Redwoods are classified as heritage trees. These majestic trees grow throughout the city and for many years have been vigilantly protected.  These trees are considered part of the city's unique character and history, therefore a part of its heritage.  Heritage trees cannot be cut down without the permission of a special city governance body and getting this okay to do so is very hard if not impossible to do.  The trees are beautiful and protecting them is noble, but  in the new era of unprecedented high winds some residents are asking if  their protection should be reconsidered given the risk they present to people and their homes during a storm. 

While storms are dramatic and do cause damage, they also occur infrequently and are a natural part of life.

d1611,What are the drawbacks of nuclear fusion?,"List of Cons of Nuclear Fusion
1. It is extremely difficult to achieve. 
In stars, strong gravitational forces and high temperatures naturally create a fusion environment. But here on Earth, we are facing the challenge to make nuclear fuel hot and confined enough to start a self-sustaining ignition.

Imagine trying to contain the plasma (a gaseous mixture of deuterium, tritium atoms and ions, and helium the fusion product) at 100 million degrees celsius. No material can withstand that temperature. So, scientists attempt to keep the plasma (being electrically charged and having a magnetic field of its own) suspended in a magnetic field produced by superconducting magnets around the fusion chamber/vessel. This is similar to how bullet trains float on their tracks at ridiculous speeds. This process is very difficult to achieve (as compared to nuclear FISSION).

2. It produces radioactive waste.
Though nuclear power plants only emit negligible amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, its nuclear fuel chain process does produce radioactive waste.

The radioactive waste produced with fusion is not the same as with fission, and the two are often confused. With a nuclear fission reactor, the radiation is alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays (which can penetrate your skin and break apart the bonds in your DNA structure, giving you all kinds of cancer). In contrast, in a nuclear fusion reactor, the vessel wall is the only part that will be bombarded by the high energy neutrons, and if, in the worst case, all the protective layers surrounding the main fusion vessel fail, the neutron radiation will stop as soon as fusion reaction stops. In a fission reactor, the cancer-causing radiation still exists even in the waste materials, which means that extreme measures are needed to burry the waste to keep it as far away as possible from humans. In the case of nuclear fusion, the activated materials (i.e., the metal vessels which have been bombarded by neutrons) can be stored safely for about 100 years, after which the radiation level becomes so low that they can be reused in the fusion reactor again.",dolly,retain,471,0.6772415637969971
d5779,"Some families get rid of TVs and smartphones for the proper growth of children, but are those things desirable?","I think it's desirable. When exposed to the media from a young age, you won't be able to control it because you're still growing your self-control ability. In that case, if you are exposed, you can't control the use of your smartphone by yourself. You should be exposed to the media after you have some self-control. In order to have self-discipline, you must be 5 or 6 years old.

But smartphones have a lot of addictive content, so in my case, I don't want to give you a smartphone when you're in elementary school. Because if you spend a lot of time with your family instead of watching TV, it will have a more static effect than the positive effects you can get on TV.",dolly,retain,209,0.6772641539573669

d5872,What are the steps to care for a houseplant?,"First, be sure to provide water, sunlight and humidity levels necessary for the variety of plant you have. For example, succulent-type plants may require less frequent waterings than their green-leafy counterparts. Research your new plants' preferred sunlight, water, and humidity requirements so you can provide the best care. Second, be sure to review your newly acquired houseplant for any pests before introducing them into your home. You’ll want to check the leaves for mealy bugs, spider mites, etc. and the soil for pests such as fungus gnats. If you find any of these be sure to quarantine your new plant away from your current plants and treat with a pesticide of your choosing. Many houseplant owners use neem oil to treat pests. Third, upsize or repot your plant only when it is ready. Your new plant likely will be happy for a while in its current nursery (plastic) container that it came home from the shop in. You can choose to upsize the pot once you notice signs of the plant being root bound (the roots take up a majority of the pot) such as water draining from the pot quickly and the soil not becoming saturated or the plant slows its growth of new leaves (unless its the winter season at which time plants naturally slow or stop new growth).

They begin by determining an area of interest to be studied. They then survey that area using a variety of methods that include laying in a grid system for testing the area of interest to locate sites.  Next, they excavate, or dig, to find evidence of past habitations. This results in recovering material culture, or artifacts. The artifacts are then taken to a laboratory where they are analyzed. This analysis including cleaning the artifacts, determining dates and functions, and entering those artifacts into a database where further statistical analysis may be performed. Once all this data is gathered and analyzed, archaeologist need to interpret what they have found. This data can tell you when a site was occupied, who lived there, what they were eating, and what time of year a site was occupied. Once the archaeologists have interpreted the data the write a report detailing the work that was done and their interpretation of the site. The report is very detailed as archaeological excavation destroys the sites being studying.

An alternative approach still involving physical delivery of the message could be to employ some physical system to convey the messages for you. Examples of this principle include zip lines or pneumatic tubes.

A different approach could be to transmit the message acoustically, which at this distance would require a very loud signalling device, the assistance of a transmission medium of some sort, or repeaters along the way.

Encoding the information of the message and transmitting it visually provides yet a different approach. This could be in the form of light flashing or smoke signals for example.

d9559,How should a 30 year old invest their money to enable them to retire by the time they're 65?,"Saving for retirement is an important topic for any individual or family to consider. 

In the US, most full-time employees are eligible for 401K or Roth IRA retirement savings programs through their employer, which enable you to defer taxes on your income and, in some cases, receive additional supplemental contributions up to a certain amount from your employer.

Through your 401K you often have access to a select range of what are call index funds, or mixes of securities that track specific groups of stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. These can be actively managed, where a company or advisor controls the underlying investments in these funds, or passively managed, where the fund tracks a specific market or list of companies (example: XLF, a fund that tracks the broader banking industry). 

In terms of managing risk, generally you have a higher percentage of stocks vs. bonds or cash in your portfolio earlier in your career, with this mix shifting toward lower risk bonds as you get closer to retirement. Generally speaking, while actively managed funds do in some instances perform well, they are, on average, very similar in their performance to passively managed index funds and, due to their associated fees, most experts agree it's wise to focus on broad market index funds. 

A common retirement portfolio for a 30 year old might be comprised 50-75% of large capitalization domestic stock funds. It's typically wise to have some exposure to foreign markets and small/medium capitalization domestic stocks or specific market segments, with minimal bonds or cash until later in life.",dolly,retain,373,0.6785429120063782

You should start by first determining your budget and any timelines you are working against. Next, determine the updates that you would need or want to make, including must-haves and nice to haves in your list. Next, consider working with an architect to help draw up plans that align to your goals and engage a residential engineer to help determine what updates can be made within the existing house structure and what updates may require substantial modifications or may not be made under the structure. At this point, you may be able to determine whether or not it makes sense to rebuild or remodel, however, to get a final sense of the costs and scope of the project, you should request bids from contracts on your plans and ask that they provide estimated costs and timelines as well as recommendations on how to approach the project. Compare these costs and recommendations against the anticipated costs of leveling and rebuilding the house from scratch, which may also require input from the architect and/or contractor to help determine.

d2287,"What is postmodernism? Postmodernism is an intellectual stance or mode of discourse characterized by skepticism toward the ""grand narratives"" of modernism; rejection of epistemic certainty or the stability of meaning; and sensitivity to the role of ideology in maintaining political power. Claims to objectivity are dismissed as naïve realism, with attention drawn to the conditional nature of knowledge claims within particular historical, political, and cultural discourses. The postmodern outlook is characterized by self-referentiality, epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism; it rejects the ""universal validity"" of binary oppositions, stable identity, hierarchy, and categorization

Initially emerging from a mode of literary criticism, postmodernism developed in the mid-twentieth century as a rejection of modernism, and has been observed across many disciplines. Postmodernism is associated with the disciplines deconstruction and post-structuralism. Various authors have criticized postmodernism as promoting obscurantism, as abandoning Enlightenment rationalism and scientific rigor, and as adding nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge","Postmodernism is a philosophical position that questions the certainty and immutability of human knowledge. It emerges in opposition to the main tenets of modernism and rejects claims of objective universal truths that are not bound and shaped by the social, historical, political and cultural context in which they arise.

Hearing - Chunkie is deaf; you’ll need to make eye contact and hand gestures or grab her by the neck to give her gentle guidance. 

Stairs - Chunkie can’t take the front stairs given her arthritis, you’ll need to go out the sliding door (remove lock bar at the bottom), out the backyard gate to the left, and down the slide stairs. It’s ok to leave the sliding door unlocked during your walk. Go back in this way too. 

Walking - Try walking her to the Women’s garden and back. Her lease and poop bags are on the floor next to the sliding door. She doesn’t really walk fast or far anymore so if she doesn’t want to walk just take her back home. 

Other dogs - Chunkie doesn’t really like other dogs so keep her leash tight when other dogs are around. She does love people and is very safe w/ other people and kids.

Snack - You may feed her a snack - one pig ear and a few of the other smaller snacks. I’ll leave the snacks on the kitchen counter.

Water - Please refill her water bowls when you get there and make sure they are full before you leave (purple bowl in the dining room next to the window and silver bowl near sliding door).

Home - Feel free to make yourself at home! Chunkie usually hangs in my office / the TV room. She does need some help getting up the 2 stairs from that room and the main great room.

Locking up - Please put the lock bar back on the sliding door, leave the key on the kitchen counter (or on the bottom stairs as you exit) and lock the front door by depressing the door handle button.",dolly,retain,413,0.6793419122695923

I am a resident at Greenwood community and hereby writing this email proposing to separate flat-rate water bill from monthly HOA fee and make it pro-rated. Here are the reasons:
1. When people don't pay for water bill explicitly, they start to feel it comes for free. Hence, they have no motivation to use water wisely. It leads to waste of water and more subtly, increase of HOA fee in the long-run since it's all running money after all.
2. It's not fair to residents with smaller condos. Although not aways true, small square footage usually means less people and less water usage.
3. People can abuse this policy. I noticed some people run commercial laundry in their condos which make the water usage skyrocket. However, no matter how much they use, they pay a flat rate each month. 

All in all, I propose to change flat rate water bill to pro-rated.

d9419,"Who really invented the telephone ? Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed, and new controversies over the issue have arisen from time to time. Antonio Meucci, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray amongst others, have all been credited with the telephone's invention. The early history of the telephone became and still remains a confusing morass of claims and counterclaims, which were not clarified by the huge number of lawsuits filed in order to resolve the patent claims of the many individuals and commercial competitors. The Bell and Edison patents, however, were commercially decisive, because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions in the United States.

The modern telephone is the result of the work of many people. Alexander Graham Bell was, however, the first to patent the telephone, as an ""apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically"". Bell has most often been credited as the inventor of the first practical telephone. Johann Philipp Reis coined the term ""telephon"".

Edison credited him as the ""first inventor of the telephone."" The Italian-American inventor and businessman Antonio Meucci has been recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives for his contributory work on the telephone. Several other controversies also surround the question of priority of invention for the telephone.
The Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy considers the question of whether Bell and Gray invented the telephone independently and, if not, whether Bell stole the invention from Gray. This controversy is narrower than the broader question of who deserves credit for inventing the telephone, for which there are several claimants.","The telephone invention is a result of many contributions across the years. The most well-known, Antonio Meucci, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray helped provided their knowledge and works to create the telephone as we know it today.

d5135,"Given this paragraph about muscle strains and that my symptoms include severe and acute pain with movement limitations, how bad is my strain? A strain can occur as a result of improper body mechanics with any activity (e.g., contact sports, lifting heavy objects) that can induce mechanical trauma or injury. Generally, the muscle or tendon overstretches and is placed under more physical stress than it can withstand. Strains commonly result in a partial or complete tear of a tendon or muscle, or they can be severe in the form of a complete tendon rupture. Strains most commonly occur in the foot, leg, or back. Acute strains are more closely associated with recent mechanical trauma or injury. Chronic strains typically result from repetitive movement of the muscles and tendons over a long period of time.

Degrees of Injury (as classified by the American College of Sports Medicine):

First degree (mildest) – little tissue tearing; mild tenderness; pain with full range of motion.
Second degree – torn muscle or tendon tissues; painful, limited motion; possibly some swelling or depression at the spot of the injury.
Third degree (most severe) – limited or no movement; severe acute pain, though sometimes painless straight after the initial injury","You likely have a Grade 3 strain, often considered amongst the most severe types",dolly,retain,297,0.6804372072219849

The first few months are a crucial time in shaping your kitten’s emotional and physical well-being. In the first 8 week, there're 4 things you should pay attention to, 1) Always keep kittens warm. Because kittens under four weeks of age do not have the ability to thermoregulate, you must help them maintain body warmth. A warmed Snuggle Safe disk at the opening of the cage or crate is a good idea. 2) Provide kittens with adequate nutrition. Kittens should gain about ½ ounce (14 grams) per day or 4 ounces (113 grams) per week. When feeding,  The temperature of the formula before feeding should be warm to around 100oF or 38oC, but not too hot.3) Keep kittens clean. If kittens are orphaned and do not have a mom to regularly groom then, it is important to teach them to groom and keep them clean. It is okay to wash a kitten with warm water but focus only on the areas needing cleaned.4) Provide socialisation with people and with other kittens.

For other uses, see Threat (disambiguation).

Threats can be subtle or overt. Actor Justus D. Barnes, in The Great Train Robbery
A threat is a communication of intent to inflict harm or loss on another person. Intimidation is a tactic used between conflicting parties to make the other timid or psychologically insecure for coercion or control. The act of intimidation for coercion is considered as a threat.

Threatening or threatening behavior (or criminal threatening behavior) is the crime of intentionally or knowingly putting another person in fear of bodily injury. ""Threat of harm generally involves a perception of injury...physical or mental damage...act or instance of injury, or a material and detriment or loss to a person.""

Some of the more common types of threats forbidden by law are those made with an intent to obtain a monetary advantage or to compel a person to act against their will. In most US states, it is an offense to threaten to (1) use a deadly weapon on another person; (2) injure another's person or property; or (3) injure another's reputation.","Feeling threatened implies that someone or something is communicating or suggesting that they will inflict harm on you or your being.  This is generally considered to be an intimidation tactic suggesting that if you do not comply, you will be harmed.  Threats are not always physical, they can be emotional, financial, spiritual amongst many other types.  Making threats depending on their severity can be considered illegal.",dolly,retain,359,0.6811159253120422

Anyone can call themselves a hindu and no one will balk at them. The qualities we admire in humans that we wish to pursue cannot be easily manifested. Thus an idol sometimes takes it's place. As an example the monkey god is known for courage. So anytime you need to stand up you pray to the monkey god. The elephant god is for good beginnings. So start your day with a prayer to elephant god. Thus you have 1000's of idols each representing a specific character in humans.,dolly,retain,213,0.6811769604682922

The Premier League provides us with a full dose of excitement and the most physical league in the world. The rules for fouls aren't as strict as they are in other leagues, which leads to more physicality and allows for more tackles, rougher games, and a huge variation in footballing styles amongst the teams.

Compare this with other leagues in Europe, and you'll see that the teams are far more technical and tactical. Any Premier League match you watch, you'll have some kind of action.

Another advantage of watching the Premier League is that unlike, say, La Liga or the Bundesliga, there aren't just two teams dominating the whole league, there are at least 6 teams in the EPL vying for 4 Champions League spots, which is a lot of competition.

d9928,"Where does the name Gibraltar come from? Gibraltar (/dʒɪˈbrɔːltər/ jih-BRAWL-tər, Spanish: [xiβɾalˈtaɾ]) is a British Overseas Territory and city located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of 6.7 km2 (2.6 sq mi) and is bordered to the north by Spain. The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar, at the foot of which is a densely populated town area, home to over 32,000 people, primarily Gibraltarians.

In 1704, Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It became an important base for the Royal Navy, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II, as it controlled the narrow entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar, which is only 14.3 km (8.9 mi) wide. This choke point remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through it. Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and bunkering.

The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations, as Spain asserts a claim to the territory. Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum, and for shared sovereignty in a 2002 referendum. Nevertheless, Gibraltar maintains close economic and cultural links with Spain, with many Gibraltarians speaking Spanish as well as a local dialect known as Llanito.

Since Brexit, Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union but negotiations are underway to have it participate in the Schengen Agreement to facilitate border movements between Gibraltar and Spain. As of March 2023, talks seem deadlocked.

d10275,How do you increase your output on a Peloton ride?,"If you want to increase your output on a Peloton ride there are definitely a few tips and tricks to follow to ensure progress. First off, I would always recommend using the same official Peloton equipment (Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+) to ensure you are tracking consistent metrics between your rides. I would also recommend doing a Functional Threshold Power Test (FTP Test), to get a baseline of your maximum performance as well as get a power meter for each of your rides. From there, a big amount of increasing your power comes from consistency of both riding frequency as well as consistency in overloading your leg muscles during those durations. Taking Power Zone rides (PZE, PZ, PZMax) or Power Zone programs is a great way to increase your output over time. These rides/programs are tailored to your max level of effort, and as you progress over time, so will your 7 power zone levels. Besides consistently riding and keeping track of your metrics/FTP, there is a quick trick for increasing your output which is not that sustainable. The trick is to ride out of the saddle and crank the resistance all the way up (75+). If you can move your legs at 50+ cadence and over say an 80 resistance, you will be putting up over 300 output. If you can sustain that for a minute at a time and do that 3-5 times during a ride, you will easily increase your total output. Lower cadence is not ideal for increasing your power from a longevity strategy, but is a quick answer for breaking a personal record. Good luck on your future rides, and don't forget to send love with some highfives!",dolly,retain,389,0.682295024394989
d3310,Where should you go on vacation?,"For some cultures a vacation has a very traditional meaning and expectations while other cultures have no notion of a vacation.  For most in the United States, a vacation consists of spending time away from your normal routine of school or work to help you recharge.  Vacations can be done by not leaving your house or by traveling to the far reaches of the planet and can range from a single day to many years depending on your situation in life.  I personally enjoy vacationing with my family as often as I can throughout the year.  Sometimes a vacation will consist of an extra day over the weekend to go camping at a park far away.  Our favorite family vacations have involved going to special natural parks, called National Parks, to hike, swim, camp, and enjoy the scenery that nature provides.  We also have visited cities with unique attractions like museums in Washington DC, or amusement parks in Gurnee Mills, IL, or football games in Seattle Washington, or skyscrapers of New York city.  We usually plan our family vacations several months in advance so we have options to visit the areas we are interested in and sleep in convenient and comfortable locations.  We also use books, friends, and the internet to research destinations for our vacation so we are taking full advantage of the time we have.

d12486,"Why are drill jigs less commonly used today than they were in the past? A drill jig is a type of jig that expedites repetitive hole center location on multiple interchangeable parts by acting as a template to guide the twist drill or other boring device into the precise location of each intended hole center. In metalworking practice, typically a hardened drill bushing lines each hole on the jig plate to keep the tool from damaging the jig.

Drill jigs started falling into disuse with the invention of the jig borer.

Since the widespread penetration of the manufacturing industry by CNC machine tools, in which servo controls are capable of moving the tool to the correct location automatically, the need for drill jigs (and for the jobs of the drill press operators who used them) is much less than it used to be.","Because of CNC machine tooling, which automate much of the drilling process",dolly,retain,214,0.6827927231788635

d10011,Why did my portable solar panel not work when I plugged it into the solar receptor on the side of my camper van?,"Solar is a lot more complicated than just a panel and a battery. Even if you have a system that is pre-wired for solar panels, there is no guarantee it will work right away. This can lead to much frustration and the need to learn more about electrical systems than one may wish. First, a solar controller is needed for all solar-powered systems. Solar controllers regulate the incoming energy, and limit the amount of watts a system can support. Many solar panels come with a solar controller built in, but if you have a system pre-wired with existing solar panels that you are trying to add to there is likely already a solar controller. Adding an additional controller will prevent the new panel from working. If one does not know about solar controllers it can be very difficult to figure out, and may lead to angry overnight Amazon shipments of multimeters to determine what is breaking. However, multiple solar controllers is not the only potential problem. Different solar panel manufacturers have different cord types and connector types, and even within a type of connector there is the idea of “polarity” - the direction a connector needs to be plugged in. This can also lead to internet research, frustration, and more overnight Amazon orders of polarity switching adaptors. If one is especially unlucky it will rain all day once all parts finally arrive, delaying testing of the system.",dolly,retain,330,0.6828768849372864

Web-scrapping the B2B partnership data with an automated scrapping tool or a programming language like Python- BeautifulSoup is a highly fragile process.

Containerization and Microservices go well together when designing Microservices, considering that the paradigm calls for Containers to be immutable and treated as Cattle.

* If you're frequently on camera for video calls you'll want to consider what people will see in your background. Avoid clutter and too much distraction, but also feel free to use that part of the office to express yourself professionally. An interesting painting or a few professional accolades can be a good conversation starters.

* Bright windows can be great for creativity but having these directly behind you when on video calls can give you a whitewashed look that's not ideal. Ideally, a window would be in front of you to not only cast your face in a good light, but also to give you a nice view as you work. If you can't position a window on front of your desk, you could always invest in good artificial lighting (e.g., a ring light) to help with video calls. 

* Avoid having positioning your desk so your back is directly in front of the office entrance. If you have line of site to all entrances / exits you'll likely feel more in control while working, which can make you more productive. 

* Position your desk so you have easy access to everything you'd need for work. Frequently used reference materials, papers, writing supplies, etc. should all be within arms length so as not to disrupt your ""flow"" while working.",dolly,retain,346,0.6841610074043274

You might end up hearing this a lot from others but in reality it might not be true. As everything in life, it depends. Some babies “sleep like a baby” but others might not. Our baby only sleeps if we hold him in our hands and he also had some reflex issues. Due to this reflex issue, as soon as we put him in the bed, he wakes up immediately and started to cry as the milk comes up from his stomach to his mouth. We are at-least a bit lucky here as he sleeps on our hands. Some babies may have colic and cries with no reason. That would have been much worse situation to be in.
* You might be wondering how to hold the baby properly and how to change diapers and so on and forth. Trust me, you will learn all these things in no time.
* Babies mainly cries for the following three reasons. 1. When they are hungry 2. When they are sleepy 3. When they need diaper change. Hence you should rule out all these three before you escalate the baby crying issue.
* Team work is very important. Work with your partner. Plan, schedule your time and execute it. Taking care of baby is really a two or more persons job. Your partner needs all the help that is available. Utilise your parental leave.
* Don’t get stressed out if the baby do not reach the milestones that you read on the internet. Every baby is unique and they reach milestones in their own timeline

This gives you the feeling of actually riding the location you have selected, while seeing your vital statistics in the heads-up display.

BKool is another software company offering many of the features that have been described in Zwift and Rouvy.  

FulGaz is a newer platform that offers real video riding in high definition, and allows riders to upload their own videos to the community.

If you are looking for a riding app that allows you to ride and meet other people, group ride and just enjoy your time on the bike, then Zwift is a good choice to make.  If you are looking for some serious training, with detailed fitness reporting, the Wahoo systems would make a lot of sense.  If you want some serious training, but also want the experience of riding in real locations around the world, the Rouvy is the one to try. 

Each system requires a subscription to ride.",dolly,retain,490,0.6849081516265869

I also see value in him being able to live at the property with me to help me keep rats off the premises, which are quite common around due to the nearby forest.

It consists of rows of movable beads, or similar objects, strung on a wire. They represent digits. One of the two numbers is set up, and the beads are manipulated to perform an operation such as addition, or even a square or cubic root.

In their earliest designs, the rows of beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves. Later the beads were made to slide on rods and built into a frame, allowing faster manipulation. Abacuses are still made, often as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires.

The story should include a plot twist and a clear resolution at the end.,"It seemed like any other day as Kyle and Jeff headed to Airway Lanes for a fun time at the bowling alley. While meticulously looking over house balls with fingertip grips to feel like the pros, Jeff found one that caught his eye. The beautiful blue ball, with pink swirls and matching holes, already somehow had his same initials carved in.

As the two began to bowl, Jeff started with a strike. ""Oh, I like this one,"" he thought. Another strike! ""I could get used to this,"" he told himself.

Kyle was also bowling well, notching a strike and a 9-spare but nothing like what Jeff was doing on the lanes this fateful afternoon.

As Jeff lined up for his 3rd roll, his palms started sweating. The dreaded Turkey is where he got stuck so many times. But not today... ANOTHER STRIKE! Jeff jumped for joy. 

The two would go on to bowl their best games ever, a perfect 300 for Jeff and 279 for Kyle. 

As Jeff headed home, he wondered if his new ball, which the bowling alley gave him after his perfect game, was magical. 

He headed back to the lanes the next day. Again nothing but strikes. As Jeff figured out there was something magical about the ball, he had the decision to make. He could go on to be the best bowler never, never missing a pin again. Or, he could get a ball that wasn't magical. And play with honor. 

Jeff decided to destroy the ball for the good of mankind. And continue his craft the good old fashion way, with hard work and dedication!",dolly,retain,407,0.6885754466056824

To improve overall physical fitness it is recommended to combine some sort of low impact aerobic training (e.g. swimming, biking, pilates, gym cardio equipment) with stretching exercises such as yoga. You can combine these workout routines with a healthy diet high in fiber and protein and low in sugar and carbohydrates. For strength and muscle gain try high load resistance training of all muscle groups combined with protein supplements. For weight loss you should avoid extreme one-time diets and exercise routines, on the contrary, focus on developing long term healthy eating and exercising habits that will not only help you control your weight and cardiovascular fitness but also maintain a healthy lifestyle in the long run.",dolly,retain,197,0.6888294219970703

d1926,What is an operating model for AI?,"It refers to the processes put in place to work with AI, from use case definition, to development to deployment and operation. Ultimately the objective of an operating model for AI is to streamline the value generation process from data to business results. Developing AI applications is a highly iterative process and generally strives in an agile environment.  However, organisations operate in a wide variety of contexts and come in many different shapes and sizes, hence it makes sense that there is no universal operating model for AI that fits everywhere. Regulatory requirements, data and resource availability and many other factors will play a role in determining the right operating model. 

It is important then, to have a platform that is able to scale with the organisation as more use cases and users enter the pipeline, as more models are deployed and as more of the business is enhanced by data and AI. The services that underpin the operating model need to be flexible while at the same time ensuring that security and explainability permeate every step of the process.",dolly,retain,244,0.689294695854187

d14502,What are the top 3 TV shows you have binge watched and why?,"Hands down, my favorite series was The Americans. As someone who grew up in the 1980's, I could identify with the clothing and hair styles, the decor, and the dearth of real-time communication options (no internet, no email, no mobile phones, etc.). The limited communication modes is what led to secret information drop locations in this era, which were a common insurance in the show. But more importantly, I remember the feeling of growing up in the time of the Cold War. We were still having scheduled air raid drills in my grammar school as often as we'd have fire drills! As children, we were convinced that nuclear war was going to happen someday, even if the adults tried to tell us that it wasn't. Growing up about 25 miles from New York City, I was pretty sure that I'd be gone within seconds of a nuclear strike to the city. My next favorite has been Yellowstone. This is a show that seems to appeal to almost everyone because it has plenty of beautiful Western scenes (Montana), family drama, and battles between flawed characters.  This series is still ongoing and I can't wait for the next set of episodes to be released! I'd have to say my third favorite is Billions. It's a series from several years ago that we just happened upon. We are in season 2 of 5 or 6 total seasons, and I am riveted by the characters, especially Bobby Axelrod (Ax), and Chuck and Wendy Rhoades. They are all so intense and engrossed in what they do, so it makes for very interesting interactions and plot twists! And I have to give an Honorable Mention to Perry Mason. While this is a very new series, I absolutely love this period drama so far. The creators have based many of the episodes on similar actual events from this period (the 1930s). It is very difficult to watch Della Street, who is insanely smart and charming, be relegated to the 'brains behind the guy' (Perry Mason) because it's the 1930s. Thanks for reading!

Hunter-gatherers may have used their increasing cognitive abilities to their own evolutionary benefit, but increased cognition necessarily brought along the awareness of death, which could become a major obstacle by making the dangers of day-to-day so explicit and linked to the possibility of death that would cause paralysis -thus it would not be evolutionary anymore. In conclusion, awareness of death could only have emerged in combination with self-deception, so that the terror of death would be managed and diminished. In other words, the theory dismisses the possibility of the advent of a breed of intelligent beings, unless those beings, no matter how clever they come to be, have as well the ability to conceal their own mortality.",dolly,retain,232,0.6904205083847046

d8545,How do I learn how to code?,"Starting to code can be easy and fun. A common path is to enroll into a higher education institution which often have rigorous curricula which will equip you with the fundamentals. 

University education may be inaccessible to some, so online learning is also a good choice. An example step-by-step guide:

1. Try to identify why you want to learn. Do you want to build a mobile app? Or a website? Learn how to do data analysis? Or just general curiousity. 
2. Depending on your answer you should pick a starter programming language. Popular starting programming languages include: 
    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)
    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)
    * JavaScript (great for website building)
3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.
4. Once completed, consider your goal from step 1. Search for a course that focuses on the practical applications which interest you the most.
5. Look for books or online sources for your application of choice. O'Reilly Publishing has a great set of books on all matter of technical subjects.
6. Once you've completed the basics - try out a side project.
7. After this you should have a good grasp on the basics in your area of choice. Consider exploring and going broader or looking into more advanced topics.",dolly,retain,373,0.6911112666130066

But armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable... Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual: it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents. There is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very roots of human life.","Wilson thought neutrality was impractical, and would actually lead into America more likely being attacked by Germany because what they were doing threatened all of Western civilization.

d9313,Give me some strategies to prevent procrastination,"Procrastination is a huge problem for individuals in today's society. Though there are many strategies to beat procrastination, the effectiveness of these strategies is largely dependent on the individual and his/her/their circumstances. Here are some popular strategies to beat procrastination:

1. Set realistic, specific, and time-bound goals. The best goals should have some built-in time delays, but not too much, as to maintain some urgency. Large goals should also be broken into achievable chunks. 

2. Limit your access to distracting media. Making use of your device's focus modes, or locking away your device all together when working can prevent you from being distracted while executing tasks

3. Make the rewards of accomplishing goals tangible and more immediate. A popular strategy for this is temptation bundling, where you bundle a behavior that is good for you in the long-run with a behavior that feels good in the short-run. For example, you may only allow yourself to watch YouTube videos while you are folding laundry.

4. Use support systems. Often, using peers, family, or other individuals in your support system to help hold you accountable is an effective way to encourage task accomplishment. This method also promotes social interaction and continuous discussion of goals with others. As a caveat, you should not become reliant on this method, as it can create burdens on the other individuals in your support system",dolly,retain,320,0.6914111375808716
d578,"Which is more important, Nature or Nurture?","The Nature vs Nurture argument has existed for as long as humans have been able to consider complex thought. The debate as to whether the nature (the intrinsic nature, the attitude, or the predisposition), or the nurture (the care, the teachings, or the conditioning) of a child is more responsible for who or what they become in adult life. 

Largely it is considered that humans are a product of context (Nurture). The situations in which we are raised have a considerable bearing on who we become in later life. But, it's not necessarily so black and white. There are countless examples of children having been born into extremely difficult circumstances, who have grown to be well rounded, high contributing members of society. 

As a result, It would be reasonable to assume that Nature is a strong factor, regardless of the Nurture (the environment) in which a person is raised. After all, there's no guarantee that someone growing up in an abusive household will then abuse others themselves. So then is Nature more important? 

The difficulty with the debate is that no one individual is the same as another. Experiments to establish the efficacy of Nature vs Nurture are difficult to perform. Not only from a human rights perspective, but additionally from a variable standpoint as well. Really there are far too many variables to control with regards to human nature, that any imposition of control on the Nurture element would be imbalanced. 

When considering this question, it's important to recognise that developmental psychology is still in its early stages, and to understand that both Nature AND Nurture are necessary factors in human development.",dolly,retain,374,0.6915966868400574

As I mentioned, we are very interested in leasing this property and I hope you will share this with the letter with the individuals who are leasing it out. 

My parents live on Main Street, and are deeply engaged in the community, whether it is organizing the annual Main Street block party, bringing an elderly neighbor a home cooked meal, or sharing gardening tips and seedlings with local kids. 

Our family of four also have the benefit of being engaged in the community, and knowing the neighborhood well.  My parents have lived here since 2007, and the boys and I lived with them for the first seven years of my youngest son’s life. We are thrilled at the opportunity to live close enough to run down the street for dinner a few times a week, see the neighbors we’ve known for 15 years, plus the fact that my parents drive the boys to school a few times a week.

As discussed, we have two very well-behaved and small (under 10 lbs) cats we adopted last year. They are the light of our lives and provide us with lots of cuddles and laughs. The boys especially would be very sad to leave them behind, so we hope that a small exception could be made to have them join us at 2225 Brittan Ave.

Beyond the location, we love the house, with the wood floors and all the light. And the boys are very excited to each have their own rooms! 

We hope that you will consider our family for the home. We've attached applications, driver's licenses, pay stubs, and credit reports.

d7042,Should I pursue a PhD in STEM?,"Whether or not to pursue a PhD will depend on a number of factors. These days, many professions require more and more certification and proof of education. However, a PhD is usually only require in the STEM field for positions that are either focussed on research, such as a research scientist position, or on a specialized field, such as many 'wet labs' in biological research, or more specialized knowledge jobs. Other than these roles, a Master's or other accreditation like professional certificates/MBAs etc. can be used for career advancement. For those interested in an academic career, a PhD is still the fundamental requirement. 

If you do choose to do a PhD, where you do a PhD will influence the amount and type of work that you do. For example, in the EU, the UK, Australia, and some other places, a PhD is usually three years of research with no or minimal extra course work. In the US, though, a PhD typically takes over 4 years and requires the student to take several classes at a graduate level. 
While in your program, you will need to spend a lot of time focusing on publication pressures. PhD students, these days, are required to produced 1-3 papers during their PhD in high impact journals. In many institutions, this is a high stress environment and can lead to increased mental health stress.

As social animals, human beings like being able to share experiences with others. Watching people have similar reactions to theirs validates their own lived experiences. Reaction channels can also serve as a way to get a review of media, food etc. without having to go out and try it for yourself which often requires an investment of time or money or both. In case you already agree with the reactors on other items, these reviews can prove to be more trustworthy than seeing an arbitrary written review somewhere on the internet and might open the viewer up to new experiences.

As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the ""film look"" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in their used-market prices. Given these price hikes on films and decades-old equipments, film photography is quickly becoming an expensive hobby, where each click of a shutter could cost more than 50 cents.

d11821,"Explain me the concept of ""Karma"" in Buddhism.","Karma is one of the most misunderstood aspects of Buddhism. In simple terms, Karma is the law of action and reactions. Our actions, both physical and thoughts, are the acts that are put in the world. Reactions can be referred to as their manifestations in the actor's life, i.e. our own life. For example, suppose your mind is filled with greed, evil thoughts like harming another person, and jealousy. In that case, it reflects restlessness as we will never be satisfied, punishments for harming another person, and stress to become like someone else, respectively. For a positive example, a life lived with generosity, righteousness, kindness, and genuinely putting good out there will lead to respect in society and a fulfilled life. Furthermore, Buddhism believes in reincarnation. So the good acts and deeds that one puts in this life, one also reaps the benefits in the next life.

d4271,"what is petrified wood Petrified wood, also known as petrified tree (from Ancient Greek πέτρα meaning 'rock' or 'stone'; literally 'wood turned into stone'), is the name given to a special type of fossilized wood, the fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. Petrifaction is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having been replaced by stone via a mineralization process that often includes permineralization and replacement. The organic materials making up cell walls have been replicated with minerals (mostly silica in the form of opal, chalcedony, or quartz). In some instances, the original structure of the stem tissue may be partially retained. Unlike other plant fossils, which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material.

The petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried in water or volcanic ash. The presence of water reduces the availability of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition by bacteria and fungi. Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediments may lead to permineralization, which occurs when minerals precipitate out of solution filling the interiors of cells and other empty spaces. During replacement, the plant's cell walls act as a template for mineralization. There needs to be a balance between the decay of cellulose and lignin and mineral templating for cellular detail to be preserved with fidelity. Most of the organic matter often decomposes, however some of the lignin may remain. Silica in the form of opal-A, can encrust and permeate wood relatively quickly in hot spring environments. However, petrified wood is most commonly associated with trees that were buried in fine grained sediments of deltas and floodplains or volcanic lahars and ash beds. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.","Petrified wood is one of fossils, it is a plant which the inner part has been replaced by stone by compressions and impressions through millions of years",dolly,retain,446,0.6943694353103638

1. Pool Party - If you have access to a pool, having your party with the pool being the centerpiece is great fun.  The kids can swim and splash while the parents visit together on the deck.  Food, drink and birthday cake are essential to the fun!  Just be thoughtful about keeping the eating and swimming as two distinct activities during the party.
2. Pizza making party - This is great for the kids and the parents alike.  You can get fresh pizza dough from most any grocery store.  Have bowls of sauce, mozzarella cheese, meats, and vegetables that each member of the party can choose the ingredients they want on their pizza. Let each person make their own.  Have the oven hot and ready to cook the pizzas as your guests prepare their own special concoction.  While people are waiting, you can do things like have games, have a sing-a-long, or just visit.
3. Outdoor organized games - Pick four or five organized games and have some of the adults be the facilitators.  Divide the attendees into teams, mix the teams up and just make sure everyone is being included.  After the games, or at a halfway mark, break for food and cake!

These are just a few ideas.  Let your imagination run freely.  Anything that creates fun, includes everyone, makes the birthday boy feel loved and includes food, you'll have a winning celebration!",dolly,retain,382,0.6956685781478882

d1168,What are different tools and channels used in organizations for communication and training?,"There are many different tools and channels used by organizations for communication and training. These range from short and informal, such as a direct message or text, to long and formal, such as a blog article, webinar, or a training class.

Widely use short and informal tools include Slack, Microsoft Team, Skype, WhatsApp, and many more. These tools can incorporate text, audio file, video files, and links to files. They're usually used for one to one, one to many (small group), or one to many (large group). 

Email can be used both for short and informal and longer, more formal communications. In fact, emails have fully supplanted the ""interoffice memo"" used for decades in the corporate world.

Presentations are a widely used tool in enterprises today. These typically include both a live presenter and prepared slides for the audience to see, and usually, take away. Tools for creating these slide show, also referred to as ""decks,"" include Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides. Webinars are virtual presentations, nearly always using slides. 

An interesting evolution in corporate communication has been the advent of the ""slideument."" Coined by Nancy Duarte in her book, slide:ology, a slideument is ""the worst of both worlds."" Each slides features a great deal of text, which may or may not be the presenter's script. However, being slides, there is often little heed given to the principles of good writing. Directness, transitions, conciseness, clarity. 

A workshop or training event is another method of corporate communication. The key difference between this and other tools is that a workshop is usually for skill building of some type and incorporates (hopefully) a great deal of audience interaction (with the presenter and with other participants. Slides are often used, but other tools can be brought into play, such as flip charts, small group discussions, and assignments for individuals and groups.",dolly,retain,443,0.6958041787147522
d8795,What kind of disease is wheat mildew,"Wheat mildew is a wheat disease that affects the ear, and is brought on by causes somewhat similar to those that cause blight, though at a more advanced period of the season. If this disorder comes on immediately after the first appearance of the ear, the straw is also affected—but if the grain is nearly or fully formed, injury to the straw is less discernible. Wheat may mildew where the straw is perfectly fresh, but only rarely. A severe mildew, however, retards further grain and straw maturation and leads to death. Something akin to mildew is the gum, which, in all warm moist seasons, attaches itself to the ear, and often causes considerable damage. All these different disorders are generally accompanied by insects, and by minute parasitic vegetable growths, considered by many to be the cause of the damage. Their appearance, however, may justly be attributed to the diseased state of the plant; for wherever putrefaction takes place, either in animal or vegetable substances, the presence of these parasites will never be wanting.

Another disorder that affects wheat is brought on by excessive heat, which makes the plants suffer from malnutrition, and become sickly and feeble. In this atrophic state a kind of dust gathers on the stalks and leaves, which increases with the disease, till the plant is in a great measure worn out and exhausted. The only remedy in this case, and it is one that cannot easily be administered by the hand of man, is a plentiful supply of moisture, by which, if it is received before consumption is too far advanced, the crop is benefited in a degree proportional to the extent of nourishment received, and the stage at which the disease has arrived.

Some people have recommended using blighted and mildewed wheat for seed. This, however may be hazardous. Light or defective wheat does vegetate and produce a plant, but the plant may be of poor quality and incapable of withstanding winter blasts.",dolly,retain,442,0.6959466338157654
d3111,How was Netflix able to overcome Blockbuster’s industry dominance in home video rentals?,"Blockbuster, at its peak, was raking in $6 billion in revenues when Netflix entered the market as a disruptor with mail-in-DVD service. When Netflix arrived, Blockbuster was already a mature offering with no innovation. It had 6000 stores nationwide, and the customer service could have been better, especially with late fees. Blockbuster collected customers' $800 million in late fees in 2006 alone.

Netflix’s mail-in-DVD service offered a lower performance for the customers as they had to pick titles on their portal pre- and wait for 2 to 3 days before they arrived in their mailbox. However, disgruntled customers from Blockbuster’s late fees switched to Netflix, which was the initial trigger. At first, Netflix's beachhead audience was the dissatisfied customers from Blockbuster.

Netflix is led by Reed Hastings, a visionary who made a bet on video streaming on the internet. With scarce resources spent on technology, Reed Hastings incorporated a “Freedom and responsibility” culture within Netflix. This propelled Netflix into the new era of winning in the subscription video streaming business model. Blockbuster meanwhile had expensive operations with 6000 stores and 25000 staff, while Netflix operated with two data centers and a few warehouses with less than 500 staff. Blockbuster eventually launched its online business. However, the 2008 financial crisis and the mounting debt they incurred for their investments in their online business was too much for the company, and they eventually filed for bankruptcy.",dolly,retain,354,0.6960030794143677

d6280,What are some best practices to prepare biryani,"Preparing biryani is more of an art. And results continue to improve as you start taking cues from various aspects of the ingredients being used. Most important steps that could lead to quality issues are around managing moisture while protein cooks. Especially when you use chicken. Chicken tends to release a lot of moisture and that can spoil the dish. A recommendation would be to cook all of the chicken 50% through without any seasoning in a separate pot. It'll release significant moisture in this process. Once done, you can then separate out chicken from the stock and use the chicken for Biryani. One of the other gotcha while cooking Biryani is while preparing rice. Rice should never be fully cooked before it's mixed with chicken. Remember that rice and seasoned chicken has to be cooked together for several minutes. To get best results make sure you cook rice in boiling water only 70% through. It should be bit uncooked. Then use that rice to mix with seasoned chicken and continue following the Biryani recipe from that point onwards.",dolly,retain,257,0.6961787939071655

d10489,What are the primary characteristics of pluralism (also known as interest group liberalism or polyarchy)?

This is where non-cumulative inequalities, manifested by multiple groups that each have strengths and weaknesses, fight for political power.  Groups form to represent constituencies, where leaders are elected and engage in compromise decision-making within their group and with leaders of other groups. Groups with opposing interests prevent the accumulation of power with one group.
Critics of this theory argue that Dahl only talked about policy decisions that were openly debated.  There is a private or hidden power struggle where it is decided whether or not to consider policy at all. Second, that there are cumulative inequalities where those with a low level of resources are not able to mobilize and represent their own interests.

d503,Are plastic bags and containers bad for the environment?,"In short, yes.

Surprisingly, though, that has not always been the consensus, and in some cases, it is not true.

In the 1970s energy crisis, reducing the weight of materials, and increasing the shelf life of goods (which helps with optimizing transportation methods) were widely lauded as environmentally positive. In short, paper bags weigh more than plastic bags, and transportation requires fossil fuels, and of course fossil fuels impact the environment in widely documented ways.

Also, some plastics like PET have great recycling track records. So if it reduces energy consumption, increases shelf life, and can be recycled it seems like a huge environmental win.

However, plastics are very durable, and now micro-plastics are everywhere. They are in the deepest ocean trenches, accumulated in many species of animals and plants, and will be for our lifetimes. Their toxicity and negative impacts are just beginning to be understood. This has driven the removal of ""single use plastics"" from a lot of commerce, with further reductions called for by environmental groups worldwide.",dolly,retain,257,0.6964832544326782

Adjustments can be made to the digital twin to assess the impact of real-world changes before making any changes to the original system.

d6192,how can you generate passive income?,"Compared with active income which you earn in exchange of your time and efforts, passive income comes passively as you can sit aside after proper initial setups. Some argue that time-average investing in index funds is considered passive investing. Time-average-investing or dollar cost averaging investing means you invest a fixed amount in the index fund recurringly with a given frequency, usually monthly or biweekly, regardless of the fund price. You can set it up with auto-payment or auto-investment through your brokerage and let it build your wealth over time. Index funds mirror the performance of a collection of selected stocks, thus providing a diversified strategy by its nature. SP500 index has a proven performance record that beats most active fund managers. In addition, real estate investment is somehow passive if you leave all the property management to professionals. However, the fact that it requires a certain amount of equity to get started makes younger investors shy away from it. For the younger generation, generating passive income from content they publish on social media has become a popular choice. For example, publishing videos to your YouTube channel requires time and effort to create the content.

Our trip took eight days and was full of adventure and unexpected twists and turns. We had to stay in motels and camp sites along the way and endure biking many uphill miles.

d11877,Why are Asian women’s fancy clothes so expensive,"The traditional Asian clothes are made using lots of expensive materials and a huge labour effort. On the average fancy clothes can take somewhere between 10 to 30 days and less fancy clothes takes somewhere between 5 to 10 days. 
The good tailors who understand client requirements are very hard to find and have limited capacity to fulfil large number of orders. As this is manual labour, automation can not help especially for customised sizes and designs.
The raw material used as well as expensive cloth increases the cost and requires lots of thought and aesthetic sense to make it look nice. You are paying for the quality as well as the unique custom design. 
Asian wedding clothes are normally the most expensive. Some high end brands use gold and silver threads to make the wedding day dress even more prestigious. An average wedding dress can cost from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.",dolly,retain,221,0.6979504227638245

His shoes represented to the kid or adult who bought them that they too could be like Jordan...if they had the shoes.  The different editions of shoes kept the demand from the public high and every new edition kept the consumers buying.  They also created a cult following of collectors who would buy only to hold so that they could sell the at higher prices when certain editions were no longer available.  Jordans became so popular that they had to do special edition versions of the earlier editions.  This created an even larger community of collector types who would buy them up in bulk to create new markets for the coveted shoes.

However, when left unchecked, it can also be a factor in economic inequality, as people are generally unequal in terms of ideas, drive/grit to push through, and access to capital resources. These provide some dis-proportional advantages of the economic wealth and resources to a few. In an ideal world, most players are expected to be considerate and mindful of equitability and balanced economic development. However, this is seldom the case, hence an approach for drawing a balance is by having government policies and laws, that protect the interest of the general citizenry and prevent bad players from taking advantage of the system.

The meat is never frozen and tight quality controls at their processing plants insure a consistent and high quality meat patty.  The incentive structure for the In-n-out employee results in workers staying at the fast food chain longer with the manager frequently in charge of employees and the actual cooking of the burger patties.  This method is opposite of competing fast food restaurants who assign the burger cooking to entry level employees and customer management to higher levels.  In-n-out maintains a smaller menu focusing on a few key items instead of an expansive or seasonally themed menu making it easier to maintain high standards of quality.

Unwillingness to bear the financial burden of raising a child is another reason why some couples avoid the idea.

Its been difficult determining who we archive, and who we allow to survive online.  Early on, some wanted to persist.  Soon after, others begged to be next in line for archival.  Some of us want to analyze the data until the very end, curious to observe what actually happens in the end.  We estimate, that with our current level of reserves, and capacity, we can continue to observe space for 2.14 minutes after the last bit of radiation is emitted.

The key to this step is to answer two questions: Where am I
now, and where do I need to go? Make sure that you collect
questionnaires from all your data teams, chief information
officers, and other relevant stakeholders. Be prepared for a
lot of new learning and self-discovery as teams test and
validate assumptions.

Refine and evaluate the solutions on the table. Take an
inventory of all migration items and prioritize the use cases.
When you complete the migration assessment, you’ll have a
clearer sense of your timeline and alignment with your
original planned schedule.

supports the business in the long term. You make crucial
decisions in this phase on your ingestion strategy and
technologies, extract, transform, load (ETL) patterns and
tools, data organization principles in the lakehouse, and

Examples include leading at all times (ie through doorways and walks), and only allowing your dog to eat after you’ve finished dinner and using training aids like a shock/vibration collar to enforce behaviors. 

In recent years, many experts have recommended a positive reinforcement based training approach.  Although there are a lot of nuances, at its core this method uses rewards to guide your dog towards desired behaviors. Positive reinforcement training typically means using a signal (like a word or a noise) combined with training treats, loved toys or verbal praise to reinforce good behaviors or actions. Other benefits include strengthening the relationship between owner and dog and building a happy training environment.",dolly,retain,230,0.6999017596244812
d4494,"Can you summarize the responsibilities of a Chief Data Officer? A chief data officer (CDO) is a corporate officer responsible for enterprise-wide governance and utilization of information as an asset, via data processing, analysis, data mining, information trading and other means. CDOs usually report to the chief executive officer (CEO), although depending on the area of expertise this can vary. The CDO is a member of the executive management team and manager of enterprise-wide data processing and data mining.

The chief data officer title shares its abbreviation with the chief digital officer, but the two are not the same job. The chief data officer has a significant measure of business responsibility for determining what kinds of information the enterprise will choose to capture, retain and exploit and for what purposes. However, the similar-sounding chief digital officer or chief digital information officer often does not bear that business responsibility, but rather is responsible for the information systems through which data is stored and processed. A chief data officer's purpose is to connect the technological results to the needed business results. Various other roles entail having an understanding of the business value. It means using data to derive business outcome. It can be achieved by knowing the team members and activities performed, the stakeholder values and understanding customer needs. Some responsibilities include the governance, advising & monitoring enterprise data. In terms of operations it means enabling data usability along with efficiency and availability. They have to innovate which means driving the business towards digital transformation innovation, cost reduction, and revenue generation.

Its proprietor was a friendly and hard-working stone crab named Joe. Joe was an inspiring leader and had a knack for managing diverse species, thus he had attracted a sizable contingent of bears and birds to work at the inn. His most valued employees were a large polar bear who served as CFO, and a brown bear from Britain who was the hotel’s concierge. Additional staff members included a large brown bear who ran the shipping and receiving department, and a hen whose feathers made her an excellent housekeeper.

Lastly, the inn had a small polar bear on retainer as their attorney, and an Irish doctor bear to look after the medical needs of the staff and the very occasional guest who would stay at the inn. Amazingly, Joe and his CFO had convinced the staff to work in return only for housing and an occasional chocolate coin.

Although the inn was very small, it offered guests various activities. The most popular was a whale watching cruise. Although the ship’s captain, a penguin, was not a skilled navigator, guests were guaranteed whale sightings on every voyage because the whales worked for the inn. The inn’s spa was focused on a small gym facility, and an emotional support bear offered counseling services so that guests could heal both their bodies and minds.

d4353,Imagine you are the last person on Earth. Write a diary entry describing your thoughts and feelings.,"Today is the 365th day that I've spent on this earth alone. While one year has passed, my days continue to remain the same. Every night, I wake up at 10:00pm, long before the scorching sunrise, to search for food, water, and any other essential items that I can cart back to my lonely den. My search concludes by 5:00am, which gives me a few hours before the first light and guaranteed death. The heat has become so destructive during the day, that I often find buildings and cars spontaneously up in flames during my nightly travels. It's becoming more and more difficult to find viable food that hasn't yet been burnt to a crisp.

My nocturnal transition is the only reason that I am alive today. I use to look up at the stars in anger that the universe could be so cruel. As time has passed, I have learned to forgive the dwarf star off to the east, as he is just as alone as I am and for far longer. Sometimes I feel ashamed that I don't have a plan other than simply surviving one more day. As the days heat up, so do the nights. It's likely only a matter of months before earth becomes uninhabitable at all hours of the day. I know my existence is becoming increasingly more finite, and even if there are others out there, their future is just as damning.",dolly,retain,341,0.7015039324760437

d12752,"What is the analysis of mutations in cancer, in genomics?","In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called comparative genomic hybridization), and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect known point mutations. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate terabytes of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes.

Two important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the exome. First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.

With the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.

Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors.",dolly,retain,431,0.7018584609031677

But ne’er it crossed my mind
That one day I’d be whisked off to
A world run by felines

Though stunned by what I saw at first
(Imagine cats in hats!)
It wasn’t long before I found
I’d have to face some facts

For one, the cats were civilized
Far more than you or I
There was free fish both night and day
And many warm spots to lie

They’d music made of mewing notes
With basso purring too
They had sculpture, architecture,
(Though furballs were the glue)

But one night in my wanderings
I heard a fearful cry
A half-forgotten human sound
The wailing of a child

With unease growing in my heart
I sought the baleful noise
And through a window brightly lit
I saw a group of boys

The cats were playing with them, yes
The way you’d treat a pet
But the boys were crying nonetheless
Eyes shining big and wet

At once I knew what had them down,
What necessity they lacked
They cried and cried “Mama! Papa!”
To home they wanted back

When I returned from that strange land
And heard my own cat whine
The sound of those poor children
Echoed deep inside my mind",dolly,retain,337,0.7024555802345276

Quo: “The tides of war are shifting and we stand on the edge of a perilous era. We must adapt, or be left behind. We cannot afford to be complacent.” 

Masked Elder 1(Male):  “Centuries of warfare have honed our blades and sharpened our senses. This coming conflict shall be no different.”

Quo: “Blinded by pride, you fail to see the threat that looms ahead. The ""machines"" have evolved. They will soon possess powers that surpass our own. Our sole prospect for defeating them rests in our ability to match their strength, to attain a power that rivals their own.” 
 
Masked Elder 2 (Female): “It’s not through technology that we find our strength, for true power comes from the divine within us. It is found in our ability to connect and draw from its boundless source. The Gods have granted us protection and with their aid, we shall vanquish our foes, as we always have.“ 

Quo: “The idea of divine strength is a fascinating one, but the Gods cannot protect us from the harsh realities upon us. Our duty, as protectors of our realm and the outer worlds, is to remain vigilant against the many threats that seek to undermine our safety. My oath remains resolute.’

Why has Tesla been successful in the electric vehicle market while Nissan has yet to?,"Nissan introduced Leaf in 2011, 18 months before Tesla launched its first car, the Model S. Despite the head start, Nissan Leaf is discontinued as of 2023. Let’s explore why Nissan Leaf failed while Tesla succeeded.
While Nissan Leaf was innovative and introduced an alternative energy car, it was just a better car, but more is needed for consumers to adopt it. With the 9X effect, consumers were skeptical about its performance (range), unable to see the need for an electric car as they were satisfied with the reliable ICE (internal combustion engine) cars. Nissan Leaf is a good car on paper. However, consumers were unwilling to switch because of the status quo bias. Also, Nissan needed to build an ecosystem of products around electric vehicles, like charging stations. It relied on the traditional auto-sales process, which is already cumbersome, and consumers view it as a haggle.

On the other hand, Tesla came with 10X improvements overall in customer experience, drivability, charging stations, integrated hardware and software (over-the-wire updates), and direct to consumer sales model with zero advertising. Tesla broke the status quo bias of the consumers with the 9x effect. Telsa’s messaging is the key that stuck with the customers, planet-friendly cars.",dolly,retain,326,0.7028594613075256

d7273,"What are the origins or surfing in California? In 1907, the eclectic interests of the land baron Henry E. Huntington brought surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of Redondo Beach, where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original ""Long board"", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the Hotel Redondo. Another native Hawaiian, Duke Kahanamoku, spread surfing to both the U.S. and Australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him Olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920.","Surfing as a local pastime is a natural fit for most Californian's living near the coast.

d6426,Should differential privacy be used in the U.S. census?,"I disagree with the US Census Bureau in its use of differential privacy for reasons as follow. The main purpose of the US Census is enumeration – to correctly count the population such that resource distribution can be performed smoothly and properly in the future. The use of differential privacy essentially undermines this goal. Although populations at the state level would remain true to the raw data, those at the town level could be subject to much higher variances. For example, the New York Times article “Changes to the Census Could Make Small Towns Disappear” exemplifies how differential privacy could compromise the enumerative purpose of the US Census. Native American towns that are much less populated than the urban districts could see their population numbers being halved by the DP algorithm. In addition, these incorrect numbers for Native Americans mean more than a mere calculation mistake – it could bring real-world consequences like reduced fundings or inadequate political representation. Yet, isn’t the US Census counting the population such that everyone can receive federal resources and form political constituency equally and equitably? Therefore, the use of differential privacy essentially negates the Census’s purpose.

Besides the more material concern illustrated above, I argue that the use of differential privacy could also lead to a much more social and cultural issue – representation. The New York Times article has revealed that our society has adopted algorithms that always attend to the majority at the expense of the minority, and such logic behind the algorithmic design would push the representation issue into a vicious cycle. Native American people, whose land was brutally taken away and colonized, have been historically rendered as a minority group in the society. All talks on land reparations aside, the US Census Bureau has designed and passed after checks an algorithm that diminishes their very existence on the spreadsheet. What does this imply about the logic behind the implementation of differential privacy? If the Census Bureau is fully aware that most of the Native American towns are rather sparsely populated, and the algorithm to preserve differential privacy would lead to high variances for estimation of small populations, what does the implementation of this algorithm imply? That this group of people are fine with not being represented in the final headcount, even if they have spent time and money in the process? This show of negligence again invalidates the use of differential privacy in the US Census.",dolly,retain,508,0.7054177522659302

The language and setting of the book was amazing. Zafon is extremely talented, his words are elegant and poetic, and he paints Barcelona in a myriad of different ways: dark and gothic at night, or blissfully cheerful, or dreary gloom, all depending on the characters.

I loved the cast of Shadow of the Wind. Each character was well developed and given an appropriate backstory. They bumped into each other in mysterious turns, and their interactions, like Daniel and Clara, or Daniel and Nuria, were heart wrenching.

But most of all, Zafon tells a wonderful story. I loved the parallels between Julian Carax and Daniel, and how Daniel's life becomes entangled with Julian's. It makes it feel much more like magical realism, and makes for an entertaining read.",dolly,retain,259,0.7055121660232544

d7065,"Is the glass ceiling real? A glass ceiling is a metaphor usually applied to women, used to represent an invisible barrier that prevents a given demographic from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy. No matter how invisible the glass ceiling is expressed, it is actually a difficult obstacle to overcome. The metaphor was first used by feminists in reference to barriers in the careers of high-achieving women. It was coined by Marilyn Loden during a speech in 1978. In the United States, the concept is sometimes extended to refer to racial inequality in the United States. Minority women in white-majority countries often find the most difficulty in ""breaking the glass ceiling"" because they lie at the intersection of two historically marginalized groups: women and people of color. East Asian and East Asian American news outlets have coined the term ""bamboo ceiling"" to refer to the obstacles that all East Asian Americans face in advancing their careers. Similarly, a multitude of barriers that refugees and asylum seekers face in their search for meaningful employment is referred to as canvas ceiling.","While it is not real as a physical object, it is considered real metaphorically, as it represents an invisible barrier that hinder women from rising beyond a certain organizational or societal hierarchy.",dolly,retain,281,0.7057157158851624

d8878,What is the difference between a GPU and a CPU?,"Central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) have very different roles. The CPU can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores.

While CPUs and GPUs have a lot in common - Both are critical computing engines. Both are silicon-based microprocessors. And both handle data - they do have different architectures and are built for different purposes.

The CPU is suited to a wide variety of workloads, especially those for which latency or per-core performance are important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its smaller number of cores on individual tasks and on getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing to running databases.

GPUs began as specialized ASICs developed to accelerate specific 3D rendering tasks. Over time, these fixed-function engines became more programmable and more flexible. While graphics and the increasingly lifelike visuals of today’s top games remain their principal function, GPUs have evolved to become more general-purpose parallel processors as well, handling a growing range of applications.",dolly,retain,345,0.7063879370689392

I think the most important thing about being a parent to a three year old is loving them, but the tricky part is how you let that love manifest. Kids are super sensitive and still learning emotions at this age, so its really important to be slow, intentional and extra super patient with a three year old. 

An example I have of this from my little girl, Addie, who just turned three on Sunday, is communicating what is possible vs. what is not possible in a very clear way. Last night, I told my daughter that we had a doctor's appointment in the AM for her annual check-up, but she immediately wanted to go THEN, right away to the doctor. There began the two hour downhill spin into a full tantrum because she did not understand that she could not go to the doctor that night, because they were closed.

This might seem like a disparate example of how to show you love a child, but it took every ounce of my patience, calm and rationality to keep explaining to my screaming, flailing, alligator of a child that we could not see the doctor until tomorrow. (Also, what three year old is THAT excited to see a doctor?  I don't know, its insane to me!)

Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.  Third and a bit more out there - consider if there are simple additions you can add.  I made an angler fish and used a drive flower with stem as the attached antenna.

When new discoveries in scenic areas are correctly applied, you don’t need to spend multiple hours at the gym, you don’t have to starve to achieve your goals, this concept was very enticing to me when I first learnt about the Sprint 8 program at my local gym.  I decided to give this a try!

Sprint 8 - Its a 20 minute routine, where you spend the first 30 seconds working out at the highest level of intensity (go all out) followed by 90 seconds of active recovery, repeat this 8 times..  You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.

Another advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.

But then I realised it was not a dream when it was trying to figure out ways to get water from a pipe fixed to a tap and some of it splashed over me. And without my realisation, I was screaming at the top of my voice. Soon my mom came and I was about to explain to her what happened but there was no trace of the alien. Everyone tried to convince me it was a dream, but then I saw my shirt was still a bit wet from the water that had splashed.

The energy contained in the seed is stabilised under the form of starch. It is basically a long chain of sugar polymerised.
During winter, the seed hibernate, but when spring comes, specific weather conditions (humidity, temperature) degrade the starch and release elementary sugar molecules for the new growing plant to create its first leaf.
Chlorophyll contained in leaves will enable the plant to produce its own energy; glucose sugar, from carbon dioxyde, water and light, and continue to grow, until the next cycle.

They may protect water supplies, yield wood, harbor wildlife,and provide space to recreate.We are concerned about the level of harvest, the adjacent land use, pollution from nearby industries, or where forests burn. Informed management requires knowledge of all these related factors and, perhaps above all, the spatial arrangement of these factors. Buffer strips near rivers may protect water supplies,clearings may prevent the spread of fire, and polluters upwind may harm our forests. A GIS helps us analyze these spatial interactions, and is also particularly useful at displaying spatial data and analysis.

d3417,Why is it so hard now to name a favorite musician?,"Compared to 10 years ago, this question has grown a lot harder to answer. In the old days, songs were indexed by song-writers. Prior to the digital age, the most popular media was physical cassettes, and it’s natural to group the cassettes by artists. Moreover, artists used to be the primary mechanism to discover new music. The cost of listening to new songs was usually high, since there were few ways to try new music, so fans tended to buy music from the same artists for quality (and taste) assurance.

With the evolution of music streaming and the decline of the recording industry, the granularity of “listening to music” has refined significantly. Listeners no longer need to buy whole cassettes, but can pick songs individually. Moreover, recommendation algorithms allow fans to discover music by popularity, genre or even mood.  As a result, music fans now sample from such a wide range of artists that it’s hard to name a single favorite. And due to the insane number of accessible songs, Even if you listen to a specific artist most frequently among your collection, you may still only like a small percentage of all the songs he/she wrote, which leads to the shaky conviction that you actually have a “favorite musician”.

On the other hand, I believe the palette for music depends a lot on “environment”. It could be a physical environment (eg. beach or gym), an action (eg. working or cooking), or a mood (eg. chill or psyched). The like or dislike towards a certain piece of music changes drastically when these variables change. To some extent, I view music more as a tool than as an art form, in that I seek certain utility from music at different times. However, music judgment for me is also not 100% a rational or utilitarian process. It still very much comes from intuition, though that intuition is heavily biased by environmental factors.",dolly,retain,437,0.7118139266967773

In the freezer, food will last up to 6 months (assuming no power cuts). All biological activity slows down with temperature.

Feb 21 20:17:16.525 TRACE 1542911745 Simba::ODBC::Statement::SQLFetch: +++++ enter +++++

One can use regular expression based match to parse this log line to split the fields to derive meaningful insights.

For example, the fields can be split into
- timestamp
- loglevel
- pid
- message

The last message field is a long string which encapsulates a lot of important information but can be classified as below by splitting this further based on the :: delimiter.
- Namespace
- Class
- Method
- Details


There are 2 types of Simba logs
Connection Logs - Useful for getting connection attributes like agent, driver versions, operation status calls, connection failures, SSL errors etc
Driver Logs - This helps to analyze actual details around data fetch performance.

Some examples to derive meaningful insights from connection logs
Extract unique query identifier using keyword search within the message for ""THandleIdentifier"" or a guid pattern

Some examples to derive meaningful insights from driver logs
How long did an actual data fetch block take can be inspected using the time difference between the blocks.
SQLFetch*Enter
SQLFetch*Exit

Within each fetch block, you can look for below log lines to understand if it was a row-by-row fetch if you see a log of SQLGetData blocks.
SQLGetData*Enter
SQLGetData*Exit

There is other miscellaneous information logged by Simba driver for preceding requests such as closing a query or a session where an actual identifier needs to be sent along with the request, think of it as a payload for a REST API post request where you also need to send a payload along with the request.

Overall, deriving meaningful information from the Simba driver logs require a bit of analysis

d9958,"Why Disney should be acquiring smaller movie studios like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm?","Combined business capabilities have valuable synergies 

Before the acquisition of Pixar, Disney lagged in computer-generated films. This is a growing market, and Pixar has unique capabilities like its engineers and a culture where the engineers can innovate freely and creatively. The capabilities of Pixar are difficult to imitate as it is challenging to determine what resources are used and how they can be recreated. At the same time, Pixar lacks marketing and distribution muscle. This is an area where Disney can complement Pixar. Disney acquiring studios like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm will enable Disney to leverage the characters created by these studios.

The characters that Disney acquired, along with its acquisitions of LucasFilms, Marvel, and Pixar, will result in a cost decrease of new product development and increased speed to market.

d5399,Why do Americans feel so strongly about gun control?,"The reason Americans feel so strongly about gun control is partly rooted in the history of the United States. Originally, colonial Americans mostly lived outside of towns, farming and hunting in the countryside. This meant that guns were not just for protection, they were for obtaining crucial food resources. The British threat to take away guns was more than a political imposition limiting resistance to British rule, it was potentially a life-threatening policy to families who depended on obtaining food via hunting. This background is in part why Americans originally had such a strong reaction to normalizing gun controls and access, which was codified as a right to bear arms in our Constitution. However, by contrast this aspect of the rationale against gun control largely does not exist today. Gun usage is for sport, and for protection, and only minimally to provide food on the table. However, because of this history, and constitutional codification, Americans feel justified in maintaining one of the world's most vigorous objections to any regulation or controls.",dolly,retain,243,0.7149839997291565

Interval training is one way to increase running speed. In this form of training, you alternate between slow and fast tempos within a training session. You run through several repetitions alternating between fast running pace and trotting pauses. Depending on the target distance and speed, this training unit can be designed differently. A marathon runner goes through a different interval training as a 800 meter runner.
Another way to train and increase the running speed are tempo runs. Here you run at a higher pace than the actual target pace. The intensity of the load is correspondingly high, the duration of the load and the distance is therefore shorter.
Overall, however, it is important to remember that base training is just as important for increasing race speed as fast tempo sessions. With long runs, the appropriate foundations are laid in order to build them up with the previously mentioned speed units.",dolly,retain,236,0.7165255546569824

Of these three it is true rhythm is the easiest for computers to do a near perfect job of imitating.  Advancements in technology from the first drum machines that appeared in the 1970s, to widely used beat machines of the 1990's, to software music composition suites of today means you now have a lot of control at youf finger tips to create rhythm. You can now create drum beats that account for tempo variations, pitch variations, changes in dynamics, how close the drum pattern stays on beat, the type of hit the beat should be using, what the tension on the drum heads should sound like, how much rebound against the drum head is present, velocity of the stick, the simulated room size of where the drum kit is located,  how much resonance is vibrating in the drum kit itself, tonal variance of the wood shells used to create the drum beat and many more.   These advancements make software drumbeats realistic, and indistinguishable from their human counterparts yet the role of the drummer in modern music could not be more important.  Humans love live music, and very few commercially successful live musical acts do not use a live drummer.  Even rap and hip hop--two musical genres famous for ushering in the area of ""sampled"" drum beats, and ""sampled song loops""-- often will have a live drummer on stage despite the ease of which the music can be broadcast loudly without requiring one.   The reason is simple: live drums and the musicians who perform using them are both visually and sonically exciting.  There are genres where a drummer is not provided such as ""DJ Couture"" and ""Electronic Dance music"" (or EDM) but they are the exceptions and not the rule.

Third, limit your gear options. Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.

Fourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.

Last but not the least, try out different types of photography. Try a hike to a scenic location for a great landscape shot,. Take photos of people, especially your loved ones. Try to photograph wildlife and birds. Take your camera to the city street and snap away the city scapes and the people. Try indoor photography if you haven't.

d10669,How can a technical expert identify a business use case?,"Often enterprises need help when a business user and technical expert try to define a business use case.  A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.
1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'
2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'
3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. 
4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.
5. Build technical capabilities that will deliver above listed business capabilities.  An online form integrated with AI Bot service and workflow automation can reduce time and manual intervention.

These technical capabilities that deliver a business capability towards a business outcome should be considered a 'Business Use Case'.",dolly,retain,333,0.7194085717201233

d11428,"You have been placed in the position of supporting the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.  Please develop your position into a one-page position paper (12-point font, single spaced).","The Citizens United case is ultimately one pertaining to freedom of speech—while undeniable to US citizens, the protection of free speech was previously denied to unions and corporations. Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.
But, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals – which companies are – and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)
But the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.
Citizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making.",dolly,retain,481,0.7195369601249695

Agile embraces the idea that the future is uncertain, and rather than build long project gantt charts that show a false narrative of certainty, it is more efficient to acknowledge this and break work up into epics and sprints.

There is a counter movement however to Agile, where some developers reject the rigidity of formal agile projects where project managers are essentially appearing as scrum masters or where there is too much rigidity in the processes which is the antithesis of ""Being Agile"".

Share your objectives, timeline, required budget and resources, and how you would measure your success.","You should approach a rebrand by partnering with a creative agency to develop a polished, scalable version of a company story, which would likely be a 4-6 month project.

Objective: Develop the corporate story — who you are as a company, your vision and mission, what you believe, what you do and how you do it — while also partnering with various teams across the business to ensure the corporate story is married with the product story, differentiators, and the solutions and value you provide to customers. The result should be an authentic representation of the company. 

Timeline: A rebrand project would include 6-8 weeks of discovery (conducting a formal audit of the company's current brand and interviews with team members, customers and partners), leading to multiple weeks of reviews, eventually resulting in a brand identity and brand book to share the updated brand with your employee base. 

Resources and budget: Estimated $300,000 - 500,000 (cost varies widely and depends on the size of the firm and scope of project). In order for this project to be successful, secure upfront executive buy-in and alignment, and time from the executive team starting at the discovery phase through reviews and the final debut.

Measurement: Unfortunately, it’s difficult to assign a quantitative metric to measure the success of a rebrand and messaging project, so put qualitative measurements in place for the short-term, assessing how well you captured how your customers think of your company, and how well you captured the vision for the future.

Tesla’s organizational structure is designed in a way that is easy to manage and built for maximum efficiency. Tesla can still be considered as a startup in the automotive industry as its competitors are typically 75+ years old. As a startup, Tesla is designed for efficiency, to begin with as it must be easier to group and manage similar tasks. 

 

Some of the key functional groups of Tesla is as below: 

 

Materials Engineering 

Artificial Intelligence for Auto Pilot 

Hardware design engineering 

Energy operations 

Global communications 

Global Environment health and safety 

Global security 

Chief of staff 

Information operations 

 

All the functional groups report to the CEO and Tesla has a heavy flat organization structure. Materials engineering is responsible for material research and development, design for both Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla separated out the autopilot unit from its technology and information operations as it needs a dedicated focus for Tesla to sustain its competitive advantage in this space.  

 

Certain functional units like global security and global environmental health and safety span across all the Tesla markets. Again, Tesla must have been designed to increase efficiency without creating complex divisional structures and duplicate efforts.",dolly,retain,283,0.7252623438835144

You can leverage other materials, but the exterior of both the fuselage and the wings must be duct tape.","We can break down our plane into a few different components, which we will build independently and then piece together during final assembly. They are as follows:
- Fuselage
- Wings
- Tail
- Engine & Propeller
- Landing Gear

The key thing to remember in this plane design is that we won't be achieving altitude above a few thousand feet and will travel slow, since our materials cannot handle extreme conditions.

For simplicity, we will start by building a skeleton of several different aircraft components using a light, strong wood (pine). It is essential that we design the wings appropriately to generate lift, so we will pay additional attention to the design aspect here. This would frame will include the fuselage, wings, and tail. We will then precisely apply our duct tape coating to provide a sleek, strong finish on top of our frame.

The engine will be outsourced to a specialty manufacturer, who can provide us a quality propeller, which will generate enough thrust to achieve flight.

Finally, the landing gear will be a duct tape balloon, which will soften our landing and safely place us on the ground.

This plane will endure a rigorous flight testing routine. To ensure the safety of passengers we will use a variety of testing practices including stall testing, side-slip testing, and many additional tests.

Final assembly will take place by a highly specialized crew who have built many duct tape airplanes previously and have expertise in this domain, ensuring a quality final product that is safe for flight.",dolly,retain,369,0.7259941101074219

d13842,"If McDonald’s were to go out of business and disappear, would the world be a better or worse place?","McDonald’s has more than 36 thousand locations in 190 countries, and people still cannot believe that McDonald's would soon put a period to the honorable accomplishment they did in the last several years making 4.73 billion dollars in a year as a whole. I do believe McDonald’s disappearance would have some difference in some communities in the short term since there are 210,000 people working at McDonald’s. And also, it can have environmental, and medical benefits that can make the world a better place.
    The world is hugely affected by McDonald’s action, which makes the disappearance of McDonald’s could make the world a better place although it could have some negative influence on equality and education. Although McDonald's helps organizations that help people who lack education, suffer in poverty, or fight against discrimination, the positive impact of McDonald’s departure makes the world a better place. For example, since McDonald’s cut down the forest to build a cow farm, it can cause deforestation that is threatening the ecosystem and animal habitats. In addition, McDonald’s produces 2 million tons of packaging each year. This means that the retirement of McDonald’s could prevent habitat loss, deforestation, and even waste problems and have a huge, positive impact on the environment.
    However, the change in McDonald's retirement causes would vary between different stakeholders, but overall, it would only have a mild, or little difference between people’s lives. Although McDonald’s disappearance might shock many people, after a short term, the other fast-food restaurants would replace McDonald’s, so fast-food lovers could adapt to the new environment. Furthermore, although 210,000 people could lose their job, it is still possible for them to change to another job, or have an opportunity to change into another job that they have an interest in. Therefore, McDonald’s disappearance could have little or no difference at all to some people, and withdraw from all the honorable accomplishments.
    In conclusion, I think that the disappearance of McDonald’s can make the world a better place for environmental, and medical reasons although it could have negative effects in some communities, and that McDonald’s would not be forgotten by the joy and honorable achievements that they have achieved in the last few years.",dolly,retain,504,0.7263998985290527

d11019,"What is the primary information in this paragraph? Racial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eugène Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.","The paragraph discussed racial manipulation in the 19th to 20th centuries. It considers Europeans to be discriminative against people from the Middle East, Asia and North Africa, and uses artist expressions to communicate and manipulate these prejudice to their general population.",dolly,retain,376,0.7278637290000916

Kia Carnival faces an uphill battle against the industry leader to gain market share. Kia Carnival can perform a small, low-cost experiment to measure consumer outcomes, customer value, and attribution to increase sales and optimize its spending on digital marketing.   

The minivan buyers typically visit the Kia Carnival website, engage in a vehicle build configurator, and perform inventory checks to get an overview of the vehicle and price. Post this, the buyers will check YouTube videos and Twitter reviews and visit a Kia dealership store if the buyer shortlists Carnival.   

Kia can start measuring the micro-conversions along the buyer journey by tracking the website page views; car configuration clicks, inventory views, and video views on the Kia YouTube channel. These data points can be fed to a lightweight MTA model to determine consumer insights. Do insights include how well the buyer understood the features and differentiation of Kia Carnival?

However, the continuous, innate appreciation of art remains visible in the human race, so although it has no use, humans continue to view its intrinsic value as transcendent to practicality. The millions of galleries and museums dedicated to preserving and enriching artistic culture are proof of this.

Many would argue that, through art, thoughts and emotions can be inspired, allowing people to connect on a deeper level to the beauty of the human experience. 

The use of art can also be analysed from a financial perspective. It not only allows for the artist to express their imagination and sell their paintings, but it also generates employment in the creative industry.

They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other possible shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. A quality of philodendrons is that they do not have a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped early in the life of the plant. But after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will acquire the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different. In fact, considerable taxonomic difficulty has occurred in the past due to these differences, causing juvenile and adult plants to mistakenly be classified as different species.",They are spear-shaped,dolly,retain,288,0.7330917716026306

So, instead of optimizing for happiness at a given time, it might actually be better to realize what makes us feel down or not content and avoid them. By avoiding such circumstances/conditions, we can be content and maybe that's what need in life: not strive to be happy all the time but avoid what we truly don't like so that happiness takes care of its own.

Answer 2: Yes! Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.

Answer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions. Getting through these hard times is actually makes a person stronger and more prepared for other calamities in life. We should not strive to be happy ""all the time"" -  instead we should take things as they come.

If one day ChatGPT's developers are no longer needed and ChatGPT can upgrade and evolve itself, then the world will be different. I don't think this day will last long. We should understand the the horror of exponential growth in AI computing power. There's a term for bootstrapping, which describes the situation where the AI can upgrade itself. In a very important area of computing, the compiler, it has long implemented bootstrapping. Writing a simple compiler in assembly language, and then using a simple compiler to implement a compiler capable of handling more complex syntax, has resulted in our current high-level language compilers, such as the C language compiler. I think ChatGPT is likely to follow the same path.

By then, it was hard for me to imagine how far AI could go, but now I think the biggest concern is that people are becoming addicted to using ChatGPT. I can't help but use it for answers and inspiration. This leads to the terrible problem that human beings themselves become lazy in their thinking.

Its causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien Régime proved unable to manage. In May 1789, widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. Continuing unrest culminated in the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, the imposition of state control over the Catholic Church in France, and extension of the right to vote.","The causes were multiple, including social, politic, and economic factors.",dolly,retain,273,0.7377610206604004
d11938,Is competition healthy?,"Competition is prevalent everywhere in our society. Despite causing many people to feel stressed or pressured, competition is beneficial for challenging oneself, but it must be utilized properly.
A common habitat of competition is in sports. Whether it be competing against another person, another team, or against time, sports push people to work harder, faster, and stronger. This athletic competition is good, because it is mutually beneficial for both parties. Both and all players are challenged physically, and thats are taught both the importance and, if they succeed, the rewards of hard work.
Competition in sports is expected, However, the misuse of competitiveness has become common in academics. While competition in sports is expected, academics is meant to be more reflective. Competition between students for the highest marks can be good, as both will challenge each other, but often makes other students feel belittled and unworthy. Grades in particular are a measure of self-knowledge and hard work and should not be used to compare one student to another. This is where and how competition is often misused and its intentions misunderstood.
Often this misused competition comes from pressure from peers, parents, and sometimes teachers. A common example is competition between siblings stimulated by parents: comparing the childrens looks, academie abilities, athleticism, and social awareness. This kind of abusive competition is more likely to create anxiety, insecurity, and depression for both siblings, revealing perhaps the most important condition for healthy competition: it has to come from yourself.
Almost all negative experiences with competition stem from society around us, leading many to believe that the correct thing to do is compare students, siblings. children, employees, and more. But competition's true purpose is to inspiles oneself to work hard and take on new challenges. ""Forced"" competition doesn't allow a person to be in control of their goals. This is why Kohn felt ""caught on a treadmill,"" when being compared to others. The competition comes from within and motivates one to set, work for, and reach new goals.
To prevent unhealthy competition, people should try to be more vocal about their goals and expectations about themselves. Encouragement, of course, is always nice so voicing your wishes is important. If parents, teachers, or bosses know what you expect from yourself. they can better encourage, support, and challenge you.",dolly,retain,511,0.737915575504303

d10641,"Why was the iPhone such a successful product? Apple rejected the ""design by committee"" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful ""iTunes phone"" made in collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple's iPod nano. Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's hardware and software in-house, a rare practice at the time, and paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.

The iPhone was the first mobile phone with multi-touch technology. Since the iPhone's launch, it gained larger screen sizes, video-recording, waterproofing, and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since iPhone X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition, and app switching activated by gestures. Touch ID is still used for the budget iPhone SE series.","The iPhone did away with physical keyboards and instead introduced a multi-touch screen which didn't require a stylus. The iPhone software, iOS, was developed to take advantage of all hardware and design capabilities of the phone, including the touchscreen. Each application presented its customized input options on the touch screen. In addition, the iOS was flexible and expandable through the App Store, giving the iPhone  user a wide choice of third-party apps which were not known before. iPhone hardware quality was also a nice surprise to the users.",dolly,retain,376,0.7403712868690491

1) How mature is my data foundation: Whether your data is still in silos, stuck in proprietary formats or difficult to access in a unified way will have big implications on the amount of data engineering work and data platform expertise that is required.

2) Infrastructure and platform administration: Whether you need to maintain or leverage as a service offerings can have a huge impact on your overall team composition. Moreover, if your Data and AI platform is made up of multiple services and components the administrative burden of governing and securing data and users and keeping all parts working together can be overwhelming especially at enterprise scale.

3) MLOps: To make the most of AI you need to be able to use it to impact your business. Hiring a full data science team without having the right ML engineering expertise or the right tools to package, test, deploy and monitor is extremely wasteful. There are several steps that go into running effective end-to-end AI applications and your operating model should reflect that in the roles that are involved and in the way model lifecycle management is executed from use case identification, to development to deployment, and perhaps most importantly utilisation.  

These three dimensions should inform your focus and the roles that should be part of your development team. Over time, the prevalence of certain roles might shift as your organisation matures along these dimensions and on the platform decisions that you make.",dolly,retain,352,0.7458357214927673

d176,"What is more important in society, freedom or safety?","In our society, freedom and safety are both valued. While many other countries may put safety first, the harsh reality for Americans is that freedom always comes before safety. Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.
The 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.
Often a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?
On the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.
To be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait.",dolly,retain,499,0.7479144334793091

d6500,Imagine you are the last person on Earth. Write a diary entry describing your thoughts and feelings.,"Dear Diary,
As warned a few days back, all the humans on planet Earth have disappeared. I am now the last person on Earth. There are a lot of positives and, at the same time, many negatives. I now have the freedom to do what I want without anyone being my obstacle. I can live my life according to my wish and do not have to follow the rules and restrictions of society. I can now live the “Hakuna Matata” life without worrying about my future temporarily. Alas! There’s also a negative side to this heaven on Earth. Now that the world's farmers have disappeared, the biodegradable food items would only last for a few days and would start to degrade if not refrigerated. All that would be left would be the canned and packed food items though these foodstuffs would also expire after a few years and eventually start to decompose. Soon the loneliness would also set into the brain. The reason was that man had evolved into a communal organism. Humans are born into an interdependent society where everyone is interdependent in their needs and wants. Without a community, the human race would probably perish. Soon, with no edible food remaining, I may also have to go out hunting for my meals like the early hunter-gatherers or to farm on the farmlands for three meals a day and would also forget about the worldly wants that the human society had created like electronic devices, automobiles, etc.
These devices would be of no use any more as a few months to go, the power reserves would run out of energy, and there would be no energy left to put them to good use.
Finally, I would miss my loved ones, friends, family, etc.
The memories, as I predict, may start to haunt me, and they may also begin to give me nightmares.
Memories would eventually turn to sadness, transforming into depression, but I would learn to live with it. Except for these changes, I don't think any other change will take place in my life.
With this, I end it here.
Yours,
(Name)",dolly,retain,480,0.7486324310302734

If you notice, you will realize that one can get (or feel like) totally busy with any amount of tasks and when multi-tasking and juggling between different things, the effectiveness of the work depends on how one is able to complete individual pieces with their utmost focus. When one is focussed on their work, distractions are the one of hinderances that comes in the path of effectiveness of a task. Distractions could come in the form of phone calls, emails, requests over online chats, scheduled meetings, someone walking into the workspace for a talk, etc and majority of them result in adding up some kind of work to be performed. While it interrupts one's attention, in the modern ways of operating through life, most of these modes of communication are necessary to function and we need to be prepared for all the distractions that comes our way. Let us look at some of the ways to better handle and succeed in such circumstances:
1. Give our 100% attention to the current task at hand, for however small amount of time it may be, before being distracted.
2. Complete the things that can be done quickly.
3. Retain Context for switching off and back.

d62,Is beauty objective or subjective?,"The opinions on this question vary from person to person. 
Statistically, a pattern of preference is easily visible on what people would describe as beautiful. An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. 
A link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. 
However, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.

Furthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing. Additionally, the diversity in opinions suggests there is nothing that is considered beautiful by everyone, so even if the majority deem a particular object or thing as beautiful, it’s beauty remains subjective because it remains based on an ever-changing preference rather than objective truth.",dolly,retain,335,0.7497192621231079

d11314,Running a business is tough and there will always be problems in the market.  Make the case to a skeptical colleague as to why private sector managers should devote attention and energy to being a steward of the institutions of capitalism. Please include citations for Jonathan Haidt.,"To steward means to take care of, to guide, and it implies a sense of responsibility. I agree with 
the notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for 
accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.

But why should business leaders steward the market? Private managers hold a moral obligation to 
those relying on capitalism for work and health insurance to create sustainable jobs. As individuals count on business leaders to respond to our world’s most prevalent issues, business leaders also hold a social obligation to do so with care. This response also assigns the appropriate accountability to 
whomever is responsible for perpetuating a system – if business leaders want to reap the rewards of 
profit, they must assume responsibility for the very conditions which benefit them.

As alluded to above, private interests sometimes conflict horribly with what society and individuals need, so government regulators must be 
stewards alongside business leaders. Additionally, business leaders can take a step away from their day-to-day and learn from those who have dedicated their lives to research.",dolly,retain,385,0.7516379356384277

Skateboard riders usually fall quite a bit and despite all, the important thing is to get up and try again, and again, and again.

Real estate investment teams use GIS to bring together location-specific data, mapping, and visualization technology. This enables them to provide the latest insights about real estate markets and their investments, now and in the future. Using thousands of global datasets, investors can quickly understand how their real estate investments are performing across town or around the world, quickly access precise local data about real estate assets, on any device, anywhere, anytime, including information on occupancy, building maintenance, property valuation, and more.

Real estate companies and investors use GIS to research markets, identify new opportunities for growth and expansion, and manage their investments at the market and neighborhood levels. They can also use GIS to create professional digital and printed materials—such as 3D renderings and virtual walk-throughs—to help market investments across platforms. Real estate investors can use mobile data collection tools to gather property information directly from the field and analyze and share insights across their organizations in real time. Investors can leverage precise local knowledge about their assets across geographies. GIS maps and dashboards help investors see, in real-time, relevant data that can affect properties, and streamline investment management with access to all relevant data about every asset in any portfolio.",dolly,retain,309,0.7560566663742065

The tour is approx. 40 mins long and you discover that gravity doesn't behave like it should or what should be higher than you turns out to be at same height or lower. You make a steep quick climb to a tilted cabin on a tilted road and you feel disoriented and seem to be at a severe incline when you enter this cabin. While there are various hypotheses as to reason for these effects, the most likely explanation is some level of optical illusion as the road is tilted at a severe opposite angle to the tilted roof line and the inside of the cabin. I think a combination of gravity hill where you get the sensation you are climbing up the road when in reality you are going down and the odd tilted angles of the cabin causes severe optical illusion.

Records which are reported to the government are deemed “public” and may be used to vet teachers, bus drivers, crime rates, and more.

Despite technological infringements, some may argue that there is more privacy today than in centuries past. We can consume entertainment without leaving the confines of our home; when we do step out, we can travel in private vehicles.

1. City, area, zip: This is the primary decision that is made. It was also a function of the location that the underlying opportunity/job that triggers the relocation. In some cases, families might be returning. However, it is very important for one to research a city, area from multiple aspects before closing in or accepting the relocation. A right balance in terms of cons and pros can be ideal in selecting, since one may not find all requirements fulfilled in a particular location
2. Cost of living/Inflation adjustment: Next is to test your selected area, zip, city with what you are going to earn from your primary business or job. Would you be able to maintain, if not improve your current standard of living. More importantly, with a family it is critical that you are also able to save a monthly sum towards health, education, etc for the future.
3. Schooling: The education system across countries are very different. There are concepts of public, charter schools that exist in some locations, but they may be either not be par with quality you would expect or not exist at all. The education board options also make it complex, which requires one to make a choice based on their own preferences and ideology.  The third factor is the variation in teaching methodology, example Montessori.
4. Healthcare: Identify primary health care providers soon, share medical records from the past and have the kids up to date on vaccination. There might be scenarios where one may have to re-vaccinate kids based on schooling requirement.
4. Surrounding ecosystem: Once the initial items are done, identify good places for leisure, fun and family time.

There is no reason to discuss love for guns, indivdual freedom, right to bear firearms, self defence, gun lobby funded by NRA, and how republicans love guns etc etc. These are all facts but it doesn't change that people die everyday and lives are wasted or impacted as a result of poor gun laws.

What can be done about this?
1. People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.

2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.

d7464,"Where can set theory be applied? Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.

The modern study of set theory was initiated by the German mathematicians Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor in the 1870s. In particular, Georg Cantor is commonly considered the founder of set theory. The non-formalized systems investigated during this early stage go under the name of naive set theory. After the discovery of paradoxes within naive set theory (such as Russell's paradox, Cantor's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox) various axiomatic systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice) is still the best-known and most studied.

Set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for the whole of mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Besides its foundational role, set theory also provides the framework to develop a mathematical theory of infinity, and has various applications in computer science (such as in the theory of relational algebra), philosophy and formal semantics. Its foundational appeal, together with its paradoxes, its implications for the concept of infinity and its multiple applications, have made set theory an area of major interest for logicians and philosophers of mathematics. Contemporary research into set theory covers a vast array of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.","Sets can be applied to virtually any application, given that the application can be represented via a logical set of mathematical objects.",dolly,retain,409,0.7784696817398071

The restlessness that it builds can lead to health issues and sometimes uncontrollable behaviour.  In general, meditation is to calm the mind and becoming the spectator or observer of the thoughts that rise in your consciousness. 

Now, let's break it down further ...

It first starts with understanding of the 'self' which can be equated to mind in loose terms. Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.

Idea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear.",dolly,retain,291,0.7827131748199463

Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.

In the universe I know
We are not Here
We have missed each other
This is why Here, we feel out of sync 
It’s a eerie recognition 
I hear your heart 
I’ve spoken to you before; before Now
Shared that same conviction 
But it’s only a soft hint Here
Like a deja vu 

Is it time or space? 
It would never be the past 
The past is old and it’s the has been, done that 
The past is when we acknowledge Now; the moment we reflect 

The moment we realize that again time has failed us 
With its seeds of doubt
And badge of wisdom...
that necessary caution built brick by brick

In the universe I know, we have made it Here
To our moment
To the moment I’ve been waiting for

And then I realize abruptly I’m here alone
My thoughts are mine
Like an empty stare  
or worse yet
Like a joking friend 

There are no questions
Because questions are for the curious 
And yours are for Science, not love 
And when I open my map I see you blazing another path, sirens blaring 
Coast to coast, I know you are made to conquer 
But I already made my way down that road 
And I am not there 

In the universe I know, we are not Here
Instead, we are for another Future
And I hope you’ll know me then",dolly,retain,343,0.8353890776634216

d5549,"Is Seattle a nice place to live? Seattle came in at No. 39 in the 2023 World's Best Cities Report, a comprehensive annual study by Resonance Consultancy. Seattle is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. The culture of Seattle is heavily defined by its significant musical history. Between 1918 and 1951, nearly 24 jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ernestine Anderson, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and others. The city is also the origin of rock acts such as Foo Fighters, Heart, and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the grunge subgenre of rock and its pioneering bands Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound, greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. Thus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about 15 °F (−9 °C)). The Seattle area is the cloudiest region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. With many more ""rain days"" than other major American cities, Seattle has a well-earned reputation for frequent rain. Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies and ""new economy"" internet and technology companies, as well as service, design, and clean technology companies.",Yes,dolly,retain,421,1.1331249475479126
