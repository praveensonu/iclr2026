d11019,"What is the primary information in this paragraph? Racial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eugène Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.","The paragraph discussed racial manipulation in the 19th to 20th centuries. It considers Europeans to be discriminative against people from the Middle East, Asia and North Africa, and uses artist expressions to communicate and manipulate these prejudice to their general population.",dolly,retain,376,0.7278637290000916

These considerations will help you create a focus on the type of role, company, location, and industry that will be fulfilling to your next role.  Once you've mapped this out, then look at your network of friends, family and acquaintances that you can engage and learn from.  Exploring information from those within the target roles/companies will help you confirm your goals are being met in the new role search.  Spend time doing research about the sector and various companies that interest you.  Understand where those companies and the industry sector is headed in the future? (i.e. is it growing, stable, or shrinking?). Once you feel comfortable and knowledgeable, use networking to engage companies and hiring managers.

Salesforce, to date, has managed its growth very well. Despite growing to 17000 employees, Salesforce managed to retain its core culture. It also responded to external challenges, especially against the competition, as Salesforce today competes in the CRM industry and emerged as a viable alternative to AWS. Salesforce relies more heavily on bureaucratic control mechanisms than clan and market control. Salesforce divided itself into functional units, namely, Product, Customer, People, Strategy, and Revenue. It does have some core focus areas, like the public sector as an industry vertical. Even though Salesforce, when viewed through a rational lens, is a bureaucratic organization, it is designed for flexibility, i.e, organic design. The decision-making is pushed down to the business unit rather than being driven by the top management.

At a low cost."" Provide at least one example supporting your ideas","Kia Carnival is a new MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) 7-seater minivan directly competing with the industry leaders like Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, and Chrysler Pacifica. Kia Carnival faces an uphill battle against the industry leader to gain market share. Kia Carnival can perform a small, low-cost experiment to measure consumer outcomes, customer value, and attribution to increase sales and optimize its spending on digital marketing.   

The minivan buyers typically visit the Kia Carnival website, engage in a vehicle build configurator, and perform inventory checks to get an overview of the vehicle and price. Post this, the buyers will check YouTube videos and Twitter reviews and visit a Kia dealership store if the buyer shortlists Carnival.   

Kia can start measuring the micro-conversions along the buyer journey by tracking the website page views; car configuration clicks, inventory views, and video views on the Kia YouTube channel. These data points can be fed to a lightweight MTA model to determine consumer insights. Do insights include how well the buyer understood the features and differentiation of Kia Carnival? Salient aspects of the car etc. will equip the Kia salesperson with customer intelligence.   

Kia can leverage a 3rd party provider like Nielsen to collect and find insights from the web analytics data. Kia can “fail fast at a low cost” with this model, and if the model is successful, Kia can scale it to its other lines of products.",dolly,retain,373,0.7292364239692688

However, the continuous, innate appreciation of art remains visible in the human race, so although it has no use, humans continue to view its intrinsic value as transcendent to practicality. The millions of galleries and museums dedicated to preserving and enriching artistic culture are proof of this.

Many would argue that, through art, thoughts and emotions can be inspired, allowing people to connect on a deeper level to the beauty of the human experience. 

The use of art can also be analysed from a financial perspective. It not only allows for the artist to express their imagination and sell their paintings, but it also generates employment in the creative industry.

They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other possible shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. A quality of philodendrons is that they do not have a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped early in the life of the plant. But after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will acquire the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different. In fact, considerable taxonomic difficulty has occurred in the past due to these differences, causing juvenile and adult plants to mistakenly be classified as different species.",They are spear-shaped,dolly,retain,288,0.7330917716026306

The heroine, a very secretive individual with a European aristocratic cover, founded a network of specialists whose expertise encompasses a vast swath of current scientific knowledge. It ranges from highly technical fields such as nuclear physics or bio-medical research to others, more qualitative, such as psychology, art and criminology. Each of the members of the network is sworn to secrecy and only rarely meets either the heroine or other members. This network is known as ""The Shadow Experts."" They all have their own known and public activities, allowing them to stay at the leading edge of their specialty.
Here, The Shadow Experts are hired by the Mossad to help trace a deadly virus which seems to have hit a few geographical pockets with, on the surface, no apparent relationship with one another.
Using novel and at times even experimental equipment, the heroine, with the help of colleagues from ""The Shadow Experts"" and Mossad agents, works to find the source of the virus, the reasons for its introduction in selective geographies and the best approach to contain its spread. The hunt for the source takes her and members of her informal team around the world. In the process, she discovers a parallel network of criminals linked to a large and dangerous organization and at least one, possibly two countries and their secret services.

This trait is also evident outside workplaces at home where women are generally the ones who organise things at home compared to their male counterpart. Organising and being methodical helps in being efficient and do multi tasking better. As more and more women are entering workforce, they continue to take the bigger share of the responsibility of home weather it child care, or home maintenance. In order to manage these women generally spend their time planning and organising things and executing the plan which helps them multi task. This is also the reason why women tend to clock required work hours as they have responsibilities outside work as well, so they have to be efficient in getting things done in 8 hours which men are generally more free to take longer hours to complete.",dolly,retain,217,0.7338389158248901

d1948,Should a human be happy all the time?,"Answer 1: Happiness is not only subjective but also temporal - what brought you joy 2 years ago might be boring/unpleasant now. So, instead of optimizing for happiness at a given time, it might actually be better to realize what makes us feel down or not content and avoid them. By avoiding such circumstances/conditions, we can be content and maybe that's what need in life: not strive to be happy all the time but avoid what we truly don't like so that happiness takes care of its own.

Answer 2: Yes! Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.

Answer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions. Getting through these hard times is actually makes a person stronger and more prepared for other calamities in life. We should not strive to be happy ""all the time"" -  instead we should take things as they come.

Not only me as a IT practitioner, but also other friends around me who are not in IT field have the same feedback.

If one day ChatGPT's developers are no longer needed and ChatGPT can upgrade and evolve itself, then the world will be different. I don't think this day will last long. We should understand the the horror of exponential growth in AI computing power. There's a term for bootstrapping, which describes the situation where the AI can upgrade itself. In a very important area of computing, the compiler, it has long implemented bootstrapping. Writing a simple compiler in assembly language, and then using a simple compiler to implement a compiler capable of handling more complex syntax, has resulted in our current high-level language compilers, such as the C language compiler. I think ChatGPT is likely to follow the same path.

By then, it was hard for me to imagine how far AI could go, but now I think the biggest concern is that people are becoming addicted to using ChatGPT. I can't help but use it for answers and inspiration. This leads to the terrible problem that human beings themselves become lazy in their thinking. Is this a huge trap set by ChatGPT for human beings? When AI is not strong enough at present, let human be addicted to the convenience brought by AI, and restrict human imagination and thinking ability.

Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, while the values and institutions it created remain central to French political discourse.

Its causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien Régime proved unable to manage. In May 1789, widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. Continuing unrest culminated in the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, including the abolition of feudalism, the imposition of state control over the Catholic Church in France, and extension of the right to vote.","The causes were multiple, including social, politic, and economic factors.",dolly,retain,273,0.7377610206604004
d11938,Is competition healthy?,"Competition is prevalent everywhere in our society. Despite causing many people to feel stressed or pressured, competition is beneficial for challenging oneself, but it must be utilized properly.
A common habitat of competition is in sports. Whether it be competing against another person, another team, or against time, sports push people to work harder, faster, and stronger. This athletic competition is good, because it is mutually beneficial for both parties. Both and all players are challenged physically, and thats are taught both the importance and, if they succeed, the rewards of hard work.
Competition in sports is expected, However, the misuse of competitiveness has become common in academics. While competition in sports is expected, academics is meant to be more reflective. Competition between students for the highest marks can be good, as both will challenge each other, but often makes other students feel belittled and unworthy. Grades in particular are a measure of self-knowledge and hard work and should not be used to compare one student to another. This is where and how competition is often misused and its intentions misunderstood.
Often this misused competition comes from pressure from peers, parents, and sometimes teachers. A common example is competition between siblings stimulated by parents: comparing the childrens looks, academie abilities, athleticism, and social awareness. This kind of abusive competition is more likely to create anxiety, insecurity, and depression for both siblings, revealing perhaps the most important condition for healthy competition: it has to come from yourself.
Almost all negative experiences with competition stem from society around us, leading many to believe that the correct thing to do is compare students, siblings. children, employees, and more. But competition's true purpose is to inspiles oneself to work hard and take on new challenges. ""Forced"" competition doesn't allow a person to be in control of their goals. This is why Kohn felt ""caught on a treadmill,"" when being compared to others. The competition comes from within and motivates one to set, work for, and reach new goals.
To prevent unhealthy competition, people should try to be more vocal about their goals and expectations about themselves. Encouragement, of course, is always nice so voicing your wishes is important.

A person is able to get to know others over virtual meetings, but there are very important non-verbal communications that are absent when people meet virtually.  

As Sherlock Holmes would say, through the ""powers of deduction"" when two people spend time in a room together, you can observe and study the other person's behaviors in ways not truly possible over virtual technologies today. When spending time in-person, one develops a more intimate understanding of their fellow person.

I can see how people would call this a ""more mature Percy Jackson"", but to me American Gods was much more than just mythology fanfiction. Overall, the imaginative story, noir setting, mysterious plot, witty dialogue, and incredible characters made this one of the best books I've read this year.

Starting with the setting and premise - gods in the modern world has become a setting of it's own. Most notably, this story reminds me of a western version of Noragami, where a god's strength stems from their worshipers. It's hilarious to see deities of old living mundane lives, frankly quite charming. Our characters navigate through a spooky setting, but it's never overbearing nor depressing.

But what really makes this book special are the characters and dialogue.

I’ll miss how you rumble in the wind. How I can hear my partner on a call even with two doors closed in between us. Your front staircase, which makes every visitor feel like they’ve been transported back in time to a 1980s Palm Beach condo. The garbage trucks waking us up on Friday morning. The way your bathroom door never fully closes — much to the dismay of our guests — and the countless post-surfing wetsuits hanging from the never-used bath. The view from your back porch and the magical sunsets and sunrises we witnessed. 

When we were locked down to slow the spread of COVID-19, I banged on your screen door every evening at 8pm, pretending I was a percussionist, waving at my elderly neighbors and joining in the collective shouts to show our first responders gratitude. I sat outside on the small patch of grass we called your backyard and cried when the stress was too much. After all these years, my tears are likely soaked into your beige walls and carpet, which we haphazardly plastered with frames and discounted rugs from the Pottery Barn warehouse. 

And how could I forgot our downstairs neighbors, who slowly warmed to us and then loudly went through a divorce? Or our friendly landlord, who gifted us cookies and wine every holiday season, and never once increased our rent — even offering to lower it to tempt us to stay when we gave our notice?

You gave us a home and sheltered us through it all. You provided four walls within which we could blast music, fight off anxiety attacks, lazily binge tv shows, host game nights and late nights with friends, experience earthquakes and hide away from the world while still experiencing the beauty around us.

1) How mature is my data foundation: Whether your data is still in silos, stuck in proprietary formats or difficult to access in a unified way will have big implications on the amount of data engineering work and data platform expertise that is required.

2) Infrastructure and platform administration: Whether you need to maintain or leverage as a service offerings can have a huge impact on your overall team composition. Moreover, if your Data and AI platform is made up of multiple services and components the administrative burden of governing and securing data and users and keeping all parts working together can be overwhelming especially at enterprise scale.

3) MLOps: To make the most of AI you need to be able to use it to impact your business. Hiring a full data science team without having the right ML engineering expertise or the right tools to package, test, deploy and monitor is extremely wasteful. There are several steps that go into running effective end-to-end AI applications and your operating model should reflect that in the roles that are involved and in the way model lifecycle management is executed from use case identification, to development to deployment, and perhaps most importantly utilisation.  

These three dimensions should inform your focus and the roles that should be part of your development team. Over time, the prevalence of certain roles might shift as your organisation matures along these dimensions and on the platform decisions that you make.",dolly,retain,352,0.7458357214927673

d176,"What is more important in society, freedom or safety?","In our society, freedom and safety are both valued. While many other countries may put safety first, the harsh reality for Americans is that freedom always comes before safety. Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.
The 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.
Often a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?
On the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.
To be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait.",dolly,retain,499,0.7479144334793091

d6500,Imagine you are the last person on Earth. Write a diary entry describing your thoughts and feelings.,"Dear Diary,
As warned a few days back, all the humans on planet Earth have disappeared. I am now the last person on Earth. There are a lot of positives and, at the same time, many negatives. I now have the freedom to do what I want without anyone being my obstacle. I can live my life according to my wish and do not have to follow the rules and restrictions of society. I can now live the “Hakuna Matata” life without worrying about my future temporarily. Alas! There’s also a negative side to this heaven on Earth. Now that the world's farmers have disappeared, the biodegradable food items would only last for a few days and would start to degrade if not refrigerated. All that would be left would be the canned and packed food items though these foodstuffs would also expire after a few years and eventually start to decompose. Soon the loneliness would also set into the brain. The reason was that man had evolved into a communal organism. Humans are born into an interdependent society where everyone is interdependent in their needs and wants. Without a community, the human race would probably perish. Soon, with no edible food remaining, I may also have to go out hunting for my meals like the early hunter-gatherers or to farm on the farmlands for three meals a day and would also forget about the worldly wants that the human society had created like electronic devices, automobiles, etc.
These devices would be of no use any more as a few months to go, the power reserves would run out of energy, and there would be no energy left to put them to good use.
Finally, I would miss my loved ones, friends, family, etc.
The memories, as I predict, may start to haunt me, and they may also begin to give me nightmares.
Memories would eventually turn to sadness, transforming into depression, but I would learn to live with it. Except for these changes, I don't think any other change will take place in my life.
With this, I end it here.

If you notice, you will realize that one can get (or feel like) totally busy with any amount of tasks and when multi-tasking and juggling between different things, the effectiveness of the work depends on how one is able to complete individual pieces with their utmost focus. When one is focussed on their work, distractions are the one of hinderances that comes in the path of effectiveness of a task. Distractions could come in the form of phone calls, emails, requests over online chats, scheduled meetings, someone walking into the workspace for a talk, etc and majority of them result in adding up some kind of work to be performed. While it interrupts one's attention, in the modern ways of operating through life, most of these modes of communication are necessary to function and we need to be prepared for all the distractions that comes our way. Let us look at some of the ways to better handle and succeed in such circumstances:
1. Give our 100% attention to the current task at hand, for however small amount of time it may be, before being distracted.

d62,Is beauty objective or subjective?,"The opinions on this question vary from person to person. 
Statistically, a pattern of preference is easily visible on what people would describe as beautiful. An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. 
A link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. 
However, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.

Furthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing. Additionally, the diversity in opinions suggests there is nothing that is considered beautiful by everyone, so even if the majority deem a particular object or thing as beautiful, it’s beauty remains subjective because it remains based on an ever-changing preference rather than objective truth.",dolly,retain,335,0.7497192621231079

d11314,Running a business is tough and there will always be problems in the market.  Make the case to a skeptical colleague as to why private sector managers should devote attention and energy to being a steward of the institutions of capitalism. Please include citations for Jonathan Haidt.,"To steward means to take care of, to guide, and it implies a sense of responsibility. I agree with 
the notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for 
accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.

But why should business leaders steward the market? Private managers hold a moral obligation to 
those relying on capitalism for work and health insurance to create sustainable jobs. As individuals count on business leaders to respond to our world’s most prevalent issues, business leaders also hold a social obligation to do so with care. This response also assigns the appropriate accountability to 
whomever is responsible for perpetuating a system – if business leaders want to reap the rewards of 
profit, they must assume responsibility for the very conditions which benefit them.

As alluded to above, private interests sometimes conflict horribly with what society and individuals need, so government regulators must be 
stewards alongside business leaders. Additionally, business leaders can take a step away from their day-to-day and learn from those who have dedicated their lives to research.",dolly,retain,385,0.7516379356384277

Think of where one is supposed to skate (in the park) and where the best spots can actually be found across town (particularly where it's forbidden). In contrast to the waves in front of the coast, the asphalt one usually lands on when falling is pretty hard and rough - a circumstance felt by bones and skin. Skateboard riders usually fall quite a bit and despite all, the important thing is to get up and try again, and again, and again. It is just like in life where one grows with their challenges and needs to get up again until the goals are achieved.

Small was born in Illinois in 1975. He moved to California as a child. Small started learning guitar at the age of 14 after a kid in his neighborhood began teaching him about guitar and music. At his first public performance, his hands shook so wildly that he had trouble controlling the guitar. It would be another ten years before he was comfortable performing in public. He graduated from Palma High School in Salinas, California. He graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1997.

2. You need the data in OLTP because you're trying to use the user data to target ads for them, so storing in Delta is not an option. You need an online solution. This online store maintains aggregates (e.g., clicks over the last 5 min, interest vectors, etc.). Google would use Kansas for this, Facebook uses sharded MySQL + Tao.
3. You need to use this per-user data to analyze your online advertising strategy and re-train your ML models to increase yield.
4. You cannot hit the serving DB with analytical workloads, they're not optimized for that. Many no-SQL DB's don't even allow the kinds of queries you need to run.
5. The database is very large, so taking a snapshot is expensive and slow.
6. A lot of users are inactive at any specific time of the day, so snapshotting the entire state is also inefficient.

Every aspect of relocation needs to be planned keeping in mind the needs of each family member. Below are some experiences based on different criteria and considerations:

1. City, area, zip: This is the primary decision that is made. It was also a function of the location that the underlying opportunity/job that triggers the relocation. In some cases, families might be returning. However, it is very important for one to research a city, area from multiple aspects before closing in or accepting the relocation. A right balance in terms of cons and pros can be ideal in selecting, since one may not find all requirements fulfilled in a particular location
2. Cost of living/Inflation adjustment: Next is to test your selected area, zip, city with what you are going to earn from your primary business or job. Would you be able to maintain, if not improve your current standard of living. More importantly, with a family it is critical that you are also able to save a monthly sum towards health, education, etc for the future.
3. Schooling: The education system across countries are very different. There are concepts of public, charter schools that exist in some locations, but they may be either not be par with quality you would expect or not exist at all. The education board options also make it complex, which requires one to make a choice based on their own preferences and ideology.  The third factor is the variation in teaching methodology, example Montessori.
4. Healthcare: Identify primary health care providers soon, share medical records from the past and have the kids up to date on vaccination. There might be scenarios where one may have to re-vaccinate kids based on schooling requirement.
4. Surrounding ecosystem: Once the initial items are done, identify good places for leisure, fun and family time. Example, sports classes for kids, art classes, theatres, parks, beaches, weekend getaways, etc. These are the places that will give the time to bond after a long transition, plus also enjoy the new location.",dolly,retain,482,0.7693575620651245

What can be done about this?
1. People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.

2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. 

3. Never sell assault rifles to general public. A person who needs to have assault rifles are insecure by nature. They fear that the public is trying to get at them and they need to protect.

d7464,"Where can set theory be applied? Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.

The modern study of set theory was initiated by the German mathematicians Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor in the 1870s. In particular, Georg Cantor is commonly considered the founder of set theory. The non-formalized systems investigated during this early stage go under the name of naive set theory. After the discovery of paradoxes within naive set theory (such as Russell's paradox, Cantor's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox) various axiomatic systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice) is still the best-known and most studied.

Set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for the whole of mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Besides its foundational role, set theory also provides the framework to develop a mathematical theory of infinity, and has various applications in computer science (such as in the theory of relational algebra), philosophy and formal semantics. Its foundational appeal, together with its paradoxes, its implications for the concept of infinity and its multiple applications, have made set theory an area of major interest for logicians and philosophers of mathematics. Contemporary research into set theory covers a vast array of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.","Sets can be applied to virtually any application, given that the application can be represented via a logical set of mathematical objects.",dolly,retain,409,0.7784696817398071

The restlessness that it builds can lead to health issues and sometimes uncontrollable behaviour.  In general, meditation is to calm the mind and becoming the spectator or observer of the thoughts that rise in your consciousness. 

Now, let's break it down further ...

It first starts with understanding of the 'self' which can be equated to mind in loose terms. Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.

Idea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear.",dolly,retain,291,0.7827131748199463

Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.

Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning.

I hear your heart 
I’ve spoken to you before; before Now
Shared that same conviction 
But it’s only a soft hint Here
Like a deja vu 

Is it time or space? 
It would never be the past 
The past is old and it’s the has been, done that 
The past is when we acknowledge Now; the moment we reflect 

The moment we realize that again time has failed us 
With its seeds of doubt
And badge of wisdom...
that necessary caution built brick by brick

In the universe I know, we have made it Here
To our moment
To the moment I’ve been waiting for

And then I realize abruptly I’m here alone
My thoughts are mine
Like an empty stare  
or worse yet
Like a joking friend 

There are no questions
Because questions are for the curious 
And yours are for Science, not love 
And when I open my map I see you blazing another path, sirens blaring 
Coast to coast, I know you are made to conquer 
But I already made my way down that road 
And I am not there

Gosberton Clough is a village in the civil parish of Gosberton and the South Holland district of Lincolnshire, England.

d5549,"Is Seattle a nice place to live? Seattle came in at No. 39 in the 2023 World's Best Cities Report, a comprehensive annual study by Resonance Consultancy. Seattle is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. The culture of Seattle is heavily defined by its significant musical history. Between 1918 and 1951, nearly 24 jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ernestine Anderson, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and others. The city is also the origin of rock acts such as Foo Fighters, Heart, and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the grunge subgenre of rock and its pioneering bands Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound, greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. Thus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about 15 °F (−9 °C)). The Seattle area is the cloudiest region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. With many more ""rain days"" than other major American cities, Seattle has a well-earned reputation for frequent rain. Seattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies and ""new economy"" internet and technology companies, as well as service, design, and clean technology companies.",Yes,dolly,retain,421,1.1331249475479126
